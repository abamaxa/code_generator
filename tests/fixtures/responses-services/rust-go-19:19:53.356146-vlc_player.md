read_result

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct VLCPlayer {
    // TODO: re-implement using tokio::process and then implement the
    // same interface as the remote player
    stdin_tx: Mutex<Sender<String>>,
    stdout_rx: Mutex<Receiver<String>>,
}

impl Player for VLCPlayer {

    fn read_result(&self, wait_secs: i32) -> String {
        let mut result = String::new();
        let mut counter = 0;

        while counter * 10 <= wait_secs {
            if let Ok(buffer) = self.stdout_rx.lock().unwrap().try_recv() {
                result += &buffer;
                counter = 0;
                if buffer.starts_with("+----") {
                    break;
                }
            } else {
                thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_millis(100));
                counter += 1;
            }
        }

        result
    }

}
```


Certainly! Here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type VLCPlayer struct {
	// TODO: re-implement using goroutines and then implement the
	// same interface as the remote player
	stdinTx  sync.Mutex
	stdoutRx sync.Mutex
}

type Player interface {
	ReadResult(waitSecs int) string
}

func (v *VLCPlayer) ReadResult(waitSecs int) string {
	var result string
	counter := 0

	for counter*10 <= waitSecs {
		// Code segment may need adjustment based on how Sender and Receiver are implemented
		// This is just a placeholder for demonstrating the logic.
		if buffer, ok := v.stdoutRx.TryRecv(); ok {
			result += buffer
			counter = 0
			if strings.HasPrefix(buffer, "+----") {
				break
			}
		} else {
			time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)
			counter += 1
		}
	}

	return result
}
```

Please note that the Golang code provided above is not a direct conversion as there are different features and libraries in Rust and Golang that may require adjustments to the code logic. Feel free to adjust as needed for your specific use case.
