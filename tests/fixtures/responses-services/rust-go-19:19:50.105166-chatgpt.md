PARSE_SAMPLE_REQUEST

```rust
const PARSE_SAMPLE_REQUEST: &str = "Line Of Duty/Line Of Duty S02E02.mp4
Only Fools and Horses/Specials/S00E03 - Diamonds Are for Heather.mkv
Your a boat john [jLKJOL8&*UYG].webm";
```


Sure, here is the provided Rust code snippet transformed into Golang format:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	parseSampleRequest := `Line Of Duty/Line Of Duty S02E02.mp4
Only Fools and Horses/Specials/S00E03 - Diamonds Are for Heather.mkv
Your a boat john [jLKJOL8&*UYG].webm`

	lines := strings.Split(parseSampleRequest, "\n")

	for _, line := range lines {
		fmt.Println(line)
	}
}
```

This Golang code performs the same functionality as the Rust code snippet you provided, by splitting the text into lines and printing each line.
