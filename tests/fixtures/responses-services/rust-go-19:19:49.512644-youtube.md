SEARCH_URL

```rust
const SEARCH_URL: &str = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search";
```


In Go, we can rewrite the given code as follows:

```go
package main

const SearchURL = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search"
```

In the Go language, we don't use `&str` for string references as we do in Rust. The equivalent code in Go simply omits the type declaration for simplicity since strings are the default type. Also, Go doesn't require specifying a semicolon at the end of statements like in Rust.
