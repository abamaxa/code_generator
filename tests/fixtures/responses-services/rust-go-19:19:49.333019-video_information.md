new

```rust
pub struct MetaDataManager {
    repo: Repository,
    receiver: LocalMessageReceiver,
    _sender: LocalMessageSender,
}

impl MetaDataManager {

    fn new(repo: Repository, receiver: LocalMessageReceiver, sender: LocalMessageSender) -> Self {
        Self {
            repo,
            receiver,
            _sender: sender,
        }
    }

}
```


Sure, here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

type MetaDataManager struct {
    repo     Repository
    receiver LocalMessageReceiver
    sender   LocalMessageSender
}

func NewMetaDataManager(repo Repository, receiver LocalMessageReceiver, sender LocalMessageSender) *MetaDataManager {
    return &MetaDataManager{
        repo:     repo,
        receiver: receiver,
        sender:   sender,
    }
}
```
