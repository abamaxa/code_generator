get_task_states

```rust
#[derive(Default, Clone)]
pub struct SearchService {
    engines: SearchEngineMap,
}

impl From<SearchEngineMap> for SearchService {

    pub async fn get_task_states(&self) -> Vec<TaskState> {
        let mut task_state_set = JoinSet::new();
        for task in self.get_tasks().await {
            task_state_set.spawn(async move { task.get_state().await });
        }

        let mut task_states: Vec<TaskState> = vec![];
        while let Some(Ok(state)) = task_state_set.join_next().await {
            task_states.push(state);
        }
        task_states
    }

}
```


Sure, I'll rewrite the given Rust code into Golang code for you:

```go
package main

type SearchService struct {
	Engines SearchEngineMap
}

func (s *SearchService) GetTaskStates() []TaskState {
	taskStateSet := NewJoinSet()
	tasks := s.GetTasks()
	taskResults := make(chan TaskState)
	for _, task := range tasks {
		go func(t Task) {
			state := t.GetState()
			taskResults <- state
		}(task)
	}
	close(taskResults)

	var taskStates []TaskState
	for state := range taskResults {
		taskStates = append(taskStates, state)
	}
	return taskStates
}
```

Please note that I have made some assumptions because context around `JoinSet`, `SearchEngineMap`, `Task`, `TaskState`, `GetTasks`, and `GetState` functions/classes is missing. Also, in Golang, there is no direct equivalent of Rust's async/await feature, so I have used goroutines and channels to simulate it.
