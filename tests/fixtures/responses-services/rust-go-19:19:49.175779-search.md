from

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct SearchEngine {
    searcher: Searcher,
    downloader: SearchDownloader,
}

impl SearchEngine {

    pub fn from(searcher: Searcher, downloader: SearchDownloader) -> Self {
        Self {
            searcher,
            downloader,
        }
    }

}
```


Sure, here is the equivalent code in Golang:
```go
type SearchEngine struct {
    searcher   Searcher
    downloader SearchDownloader
}

func NewSearchEngine(searcher Searcher, downloader SearchDownloader) *SearchEngine {
    return &SearchEngine{
        searcher:   searcher,
        downloader: downloader,
    }
}
```
