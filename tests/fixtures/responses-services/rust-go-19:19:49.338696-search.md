get_search_engine

```rust
#[derive(Default, Clone)]
pub struct SearchService {
    engines: SearchEngineMap,
}

impl From<SearchEngineMap> for SearchService {

    pub fn get_search_engine(&self, engine: &SearchEngineType) -> &Searcher {
        &self
            .engines
            .get(engine)
            .expect("unrecognised search engine")
            .searcher
    }

}
```


Here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

type SearchService struct {
    engines SearchEngineMap
}

func (s *SearchService) GetSearchEngine(engine SearchEngineType) *Searcher {
    return s.engines[engine].searcher
}
```

When translating from Rust to Golang, keep in mind the key differences in syntax and functionality between the two languages. If you have more Rust code you would like me to convert to Golang, feel free to paste it here.
