get_search_downloader

```rust
#[derive(Default, Clone)]
pub struct SearchService {
    engines: SearchEngineMap,
}

impl From<SearchEngineMap> for SearchService {

    pub fn get_search_downloader(&self, engine: &SearchEngineType) -> &SearchDownloader {
        &self
            .engines
            .get(engine)
            .expect("unrecognised search engine")
            .downloader
    }

}
```


Here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

type SearchService struct {
    engines SearchEngineMap
}

func (s *SearchService) getSearchDownloader(engine *SearchEngineType) *SearchDownloader {
    return s.engines[engine].downloader
}
```

It's important to note that Golang does not use the concept of traits like Rust, so you will have to handle the conversions and mappings between types accordingly in Golang.
