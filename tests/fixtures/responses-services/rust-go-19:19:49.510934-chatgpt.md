new

```rust
pub struct ChatGPT {
    client: ChatFetcher,
}

impl ChatGPT {

    pub fn new(client: ChatFetcher) -> Self {
        Self { client }
    }

}
```


Here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

type ChatGPT struct {
    client ChatFetcher
}

func NewChatGPT(client ChatFetcher) *ChatGPT {
    return &ChatGPT{client: client}
}
```

In Golang, there is no direct equivalent to enums as in Rust. Instead, you can use constants or types with a set of predefined values. Let me know if you need further assistance with this.
