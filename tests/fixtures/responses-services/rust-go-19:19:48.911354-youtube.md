YoutubeFetcher

```rust
pub type YoutubeFetcher =
    Arc<dyn for<'a> JsonFetcher<'a, YoutubeResponse, &'a [(&'a str, &'a str)]>>;
```


Here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
type YoutubeFetcher = arc.T

type JsonFetcher interface {
    Fetch(urlParams ...string) (*YoutubeResponse, error)
}
```

Please note that in Golang, the equivalent concept of generics in Rust is not available as of now (as of Go 1.18).
