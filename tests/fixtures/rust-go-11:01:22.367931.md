Certainly! Below is the translated Rust code into Go (also known as Golang) with helpful comments. In rewriting the code, please note that some of the direct abstractions in Rust may not be entirely present in Go, and idiomatic Go encourages simpler types over complex hierarchy and polymorphism:

```go
package main

import (
    "net"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// MessengerMap stores a mapping between network addresses and clients.
type MessengerMap struct {
    inner             map[net.Addr]*Client
    defaultPlayer     RemotePlayer
    defaultPlayerKey  *net.Addr
    mutex             sync.RWMutex // Mutex to protect concurrent access
}

// NewMessengerMap creates a new instance of MessengerMap.
func NewMessengerMap() *MessengerMap {
    return &MessengerMap{
        inner: make(map[net.Addr]*Client),
    }
}

// UpdateTimestamp updates the timestamp of a client associated with an address.
func (m *MessengerMap) UpdateTimestamp(addr net.Addr) {
    m.mutex.Lock()
    defer m.mutex.Unlock()

    if client, ok := m.inner[addr]; ok {
        client.timestamp = time.Now()
    }
}

// UpdateLastMessage updates the last message received for a client.
func (m *MessengerMap) UpdateLastMessage(addr net.Addr, message RemoteMessage) {
    m.mutex.Lock()
    defer m.mutex.Unlock()

    if client, ok := m.inner[addr]; ok {
        client.timestamp = time.Now()
        client.lastMessage = message
    }
}

// RemoveOldEntries removes clients that have a timestamp prior to 'olderThan'.
func (m *MessengerMap) RemoveOldEntries(olderThan time.Time) {
    m.mutex.Lock()
    defer m.mutex.Unlock()

    for addr, client := range m.inner {
        if client.timestamp.Before(olderThan) {
            delete(m.inner, addr)
        }
    }
}

// AddPlayer adds a new player client to the map.
func (m *MessengerMap) AddPlayer(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
    m.mutex.Lock()
    defer m.mutex.Unlock()

    m.inner[key] = NewPlayerClient(client)
    m.defaultPlayer = client
    m.defaultPlayerKey = &key
}

// AddControl adds a new control client to the map.
func (m *MessengerMap) AddControl(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
    m.mutex.Lock()
    defer m.mutex.Unlock()

    m.inner[key] = NewControlClient(client)
}

// Get retrieves a RemotePlayer associated with a given key.
func (m *MessengerMap) Get(key net.Addr) RemotePlayer {
    m.mutex.RLock()
    defer m.mutex.RUnlock()

    if client, ok := m.inner[key]; ok {
        return client.player
    }

    return m.defaultPlayer
}

// Remove removes a client from the map and cleans up the default player if needed.
func (m *MessengerMap) Remove(key net.Addr) {
    m.mutex.Lock()
    defer m.mutex.Unlock()

    if client, ok := m.inner[key]; ok {
        clearDefault := len(m.inner) == 1
        delete(m.inner, key)
        client.player.SendCloseMessage(key.String()) // not awaiting, assuming SendCloseMessage to be synchronous

        if clearDefault || (m.defaultPlayerKey != nil && *m.defaultPlayerKey == key) {
            m.defaultPlayer = nil
            m.defaultPlayerKey = nil
        }
    }
}

// ListPlayers returns a list of all players including their last message.
func (m *MessengerMap) ListPlayers() []PlayerListItem {
    m.mutex.RLock()
    defer m.mutex.RUnlock()

    var players []PlayerListItem
    for key, client := range m.inner {
        if client.role == PlayerRole {
            players = append(players, PlayerListItem{
                Name:        key.String(),
                LastMessage: client.lastMessage,
            })
        }
    }
    return players
}

// Please note: the PingAll() and SendLastMessage() functions would require more context on how
// messages are dispatched and managed in Go. For example: What is the precise behavior of
// RemotePlayer's Send method? Is there a connection manager that should handle these calls instead?
// The Go's standard library does not have the equivalent of Rust's async and await features, so
// the pattern used for concurrent operations may differ significantly.

// GetClients returns a slice of RemotePlayer that excludes the specified address.
func (m *MessengerMap) GetClients(exclude net.Addr) []RemotePlayer {
    m.mutex.RLock()
    defer m.mutex.RUnlock()

    var clients []RemotePlayer
    for key, item := range m.inner {
        if key != exclude {
            clients = append(clients, item.player)
        }
    }
    return clients
}

// Placeholder for RemotePlayer interface
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // Define interface methods that RemotePlayer needs to implement
    SendCloseMessage(address string)
}

// Placeholder for Client struct
type Client struct {
    player      RemotePlayer
    timestamp   time.Time
    lastMessage RemoteMessage
    role        ClientRole
}

// NewPlayerClient creates a new client with the PlayerRole.
func NewPlayerClient(player RemotePlayer) *Client {
    return &Client{
        player:    player,
        timestamp: time.Now(), // Assuming we set the timestamp to the creation time
        role:      PlayerRole,
    }
}

// NewControlClient creates a new client with the ControlRole.
func NewControlClient(player RemotePlayer) *Client {
    return &Client{
        player:    player,
        timestamp: time.Now(), // Assuming we set the timestamp to the creation time
        role:      ControlRole,
    }
}

// Placeholder for RemoteMessage and ClientRole types
type RemoteMessage string
type ClientRole int

// Constants representing different types of client roles
const (
    PlayerRole ClientRole = iota
    ControlRole
)

// Placeholder for PlayerListItem struct
type PlayerListItem struct {
    Name        string
    LastMessage RemoteMessage
}

func main() {
    // Example usage of MessengerMap.
    messengerMap := NewMessengerMap()
    
    // ... Additional initialization and usage of the MessengerMap ...
}
```

Please note that concurrency patterns in Go are quite different from Rust's async/await model. In idiomatic Go, you'd typically use goroutines and channels for concurrent operations. Moreover, interfaces in Go don't declare whether a method is synchronous or asynchronous; it's understood by the method's design and documentation. The placeholder interfaces like `RemotePlayer`, `RemoteMessage`, and roles are simplified, and you'll have to adjust them to fit the actual use within your Go application.

Remember that the above translation made some assumptions on struct and method implementations, and these might differ based on your actual application context.
