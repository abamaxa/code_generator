MessageReceiver

```rust
pub struct MessageReceiver<T> {
    receiver: broadcast::Receiver<T>,
}
```


To rewrite the given Rust struct in Go (Golang), it's crucial to understand that generics in Go are introduced in version 1.18. Therefore, we can use type parameters for a similar effect. However, Go's approach to channels and specifically to what might be analogous to a broadcast receiver, like what's found in Rust's `tokio::sync::broadcast` module, requires some adaptation. There's no direct one-to-one mapping for a `broadcast::Receiver` in Go's standard library, but we can structure our code to at least define a similar type that might be used as part of a custom implementation.

Here's how you might define a similar structure in Go, given the constraints:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"sync"
)

// MessageReceiver replicates the concept of a broadcast receiver in Go.
// T is a placeholder for the type of message being received.
type MessageReceiver[T any] struct {
	C      <-chan T      // The channel on which messages are received.
	ctx    context.Context
	cancel context.CancelFunc
	once   sync.Once
}

// NewMessageReceiver creates a new MessageReceiver.
// This example doesn't implement the broadcasting functionality found in Rust's broadcast receiver,
// but sets up the structure and a simple mechanism to stop reading from the channel.
// You need to implement or use a broadcasting mechanism that fits your needs.
func NewMessageReceiver[T any](c <-chan T) *MessageReceiver[T] {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	return &MessageReceiver[T]{
		C:      c,
		ctx:    ctx,
		cancel: cancel,
	}
}

// Stop stops the message receiver from receiving new messages.
// This replicates the behavior where one might drop a receiver in Rust to detach it from the broadcast channel.
func (mr *MessageReceiver[T]) Stop() {
	mr.once.Do(func() {
		mr.cancel()
	})
}

// The implementation details regarding how messages are broadcasted to all receivers
// and how receivers subscribe to the broadcasts are omitted in this example.
// In Go, you might use a combination of channels, select statements, and possibly goroutines
// to facilitate a broadcast mechanism, depending on the exact behavior you want to mimic from Rust's broadcast channel.
```

In this Go version, `MessageReceiver` is defined as a struct that holds a channel `C` from which it will receive messages of type `T`. `context.Context` and a cancel function are used to manage the lifecycle of the receiver in a more controlled way, which is a common pattern in Go for managing goroutine lifecycles and handling cancellation. The generic type `T` is specified using `[T any]` following Go's syntax for type parameters, making the struct capable of handling messages of any type.

Note: This Go implementation uses context and synchronization primitives to simulate the control mechanisms you might want for a broadcast receiver but doesn't inherently implement broadcasting logic as the Rust version implies with `tokio::sync::broadcast`. Implementing a complete broadcasting system would require additional code to manage subscriptions and message distribution to each receiver.
