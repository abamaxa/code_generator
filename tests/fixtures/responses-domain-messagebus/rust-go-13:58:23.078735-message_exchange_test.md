MockRemotePlayer

```rust
    #[async_trait]
    impl RemotePlayer for MockRemotePlayer {
        async fn send(&self, message: RemoteMessage) -> Result<StatusCode, String> {
            self.sender.send(message).await.map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
            Ok(StatusCode::OK)
        }
    }
```


To convert the provided Rust code snippet into a Golang equivalent, especially within the context of testing and mocking behavior, we'll use Go's interfaces and channels to create a similar asynchronous behavior. The Rust snippet provided is an implementation of an asynchronous trait `RemotePlayer` for a struct `MockRemotePlayer`. We will translate this to Golang by using an interface `RemotePlayer` and a struct that satisfies this interface, named `MockRemotePlayer`. 

Given there's no direct equivalent to Rust's async/await in Go, we will use channels to simulate the asynchronous message passing, and `context.Context` to manage cancellation and deadlines, which are common in Go for managing asynchronous operations and timeouts. Go's `http` package will be used to represent status codes similar to `StatusCode::OK` in Rust.

Note: There's no direct one-to-one mapping for every Rust concept into Go, due to differences in language paradigms and provided libraries. The conversion attempts to stay as true to the original intention as possible within these constraints.

Golang version:

```go package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

// RemoteMessage is a placeholder for the message structure you expect to send.
type RemoteMessage struct {
	// Add fields here according to your requirements.
}

// RemotePlayer defines an interface with a method signature similar to the Rust trait.
type RemotePlayer interface {
	Send(ctx context.Context, message RemoteMessage) error
}

// MockRemotePlayer is a mock implementation of the RemotePlayer interface.
// It uses a channel to simulate asynchronous sending of messages.
type MockRemotePlayer struct {
	sender chan RemoteMessage
}

// NewMockRemotePlayer creates a new instance of MockRemotePlayer with an initialized sender channel.
func NewMockRemotePlayer() *MockRemotePlayer {
	return &MockRemotePlayer{
		sender: make(chan RemoteMessage, 1), // Buffered channel, adjust buffer size if needed.
	}
}

// Send simulates sending a message asynchronously.
// It returns an error if sending fails, emulating the original Rust behavior.
// This implementation simplifies error handling: detailed errors can be added as needed.
func (m *MockRemotePlayer) Send(ctx context.Context, message RemoteMessage) error {
	select {
	case m.sender <- message:
		// Message sent successfully, return nil to indicate no error.
		return nil
	case <-ctx.Done():
		// Context was cancelled or expired. Return the context's error.
		return ctx.Err()
	}
}

func main() {
	// Example usage of MockRemotePlayer.
	mockPlayer := NewMockRemotePlayer()
	ctx := context.Background() // In real code, you'd use a more specific context.
	message := RemoteMessage{}  // Populate as necessary.

	err := mockPlayer.Send(ctx, message)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to send message:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Message sent successfully")
	// Perform further actions, such as verifying the message was sent as expected.
}
```

This Golang code sets up a basic structure for testing or mocking behavior similar to the Rust `async_trait` implementation of `RemotePlayer` for a `MockRemotePlayer`. It emphasizes non-blocking asynchronous communication through the use of a channel within the mocked `Send` method, and provides an example of how it might be used. It attempts to capture the essence of performing an asynchronous operation while handling errors, both fundamental aspects of the Rust code provided.
