MessageExchange

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct MessageExchange {
    /*
    Tracks clients that are available to play media, e.g. Samsung TVs.

    Queues:

    File available/changed/deleted
    Remote Message Received
    Task Started/State/Complete
     */
    client_map: ClientMap,
    sender: mpsc::Sender<ReceivedRemoteMessage>,
    receiver: broadcast::Sender<ReceivedRemoteMessage>,
    local_sender: LocalMessageSender,
}
```


To rewrite the provided Rust struct and its associated comments to Go, we need to understand the structure and its members. The Rust struct `MessageExchange` contains a client map, a sender and receiver for cross-thread communication (`mpsc::Sender` for message passing and `broadcast::Sender` for broadcasting), and a local message sender. The Rust code uses traits and types specific to asynchronous and concurrent programming in Rust, like message passing channels (`mpsc::Sender`, `broadcast::Sender`).

Given that Go has a different approach to concurrency (goroutines and channels), below is how you might represent a similar structure in Go, assuming we have analogous types or structures for `ClientMap` and `LocalMessageSender` and understanding Go's channel types for concurrency. Remember, the explicit derived `Clone` in Rust is not needed in the Go equivalent since copying behaviors can be defined by how the types are used.

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
)

// MessageExchange tracks clients that are available to play media, e.g., Samsung TVs.
// It features several queues including:
// - File available/changed/deleted
// - Remote Message Received
// - Task Started/State/Complete
type MessageExchange struct {
	// clientMap keeps track of clients available for media playback.
	clientMap ClientMap

	// sender is used to send received remote messages to a specific processing goroutine.
	sender chan ReceivedRemoteMessage

	// receiver is a broadcast channel to distribute received remote messages to all interested goroutines.
	// In Go, this might be implemented using a combination of a channel and a sync.WaitGroup, or by leveraging third-party libraries designed for broadcasting.
	receiver chan ReceivedRemoteMessage
  
	// localSender is responsible for sending local messages within the system.
	localSender LocalMessageSender

	// Close channel is used to signal the closing of the message exchange to properly handle graceful shutdowns.
	close chan struct{}
}

// ClientMap, ReceivedRemoteMessage, and LocalMessageSender need to be defined according to your specific application requirements.

func newMessageExchange() *MessageExchange {
	// Creating a MessageExchange with buffered channels. The buffer size depends on your application's needs.
	return &MessageExchange{
		clientMap:   NewClientMap(), // Assuming NewClientMap is a constructor for ClientMap.
		sender:      make(chan ReceivedRemoteMessage, 100), // Example buffer size.
		receiver:    make(chan ReceivedRemoteMessage, 100),
		localSender: NewLocalMessageSender(), // Assuming NewLocalMessageSender is a constructor for LocalMessageSender.
		close:       make(chan struct{}),
	}
}
```

Note:
1. Go does not have a direct equivalent of Rust's `broadcast::Sender`; however, you can achieve similar functionality using channels, perhaps combined with sync primitives like `sync.WaitGroup` for managing goroutines that need to receive the broadcast message. Alternatively, there are third-party Go packages that implement pub/sub or broadcast functionality.
2. The `newMessageExchange` function in Go initializes a `MessageExchange` struct with sensible defaults or provided values. Go constructors are typically implemented as functions that return an instance of the desired type.
3. Proper handling of closing and cleanup is essential, especially in concurrent applications. The `close` channel in `MessageExchange` can help coordinate a graceful shutdown of the exchange, signaling to goroutines when they should cease operations and clean up resources.
