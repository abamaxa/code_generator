MockRemotePlayer

```rust
    impl MockRemotePlayer {
        fn new(address: SocketAddr) -> Arc<Self> {
            let (sender, _) = channel::<RemoteMessage>(100);
            Arc::new(Self {
                _address: address,
                sender,
            })
        }
    }
```


Given the provided Rust snippet that shows a method for creating a new instance of `MockRemotePlayer` using `Arc` for reference counting and a communication channel, below is the equivalent code in Go, leveraging Go's built-in concurrency primitive, channels, and using pointers for shared access instead of `Arc`. Note that Go does not have a direct equivalent to Rust's `Arc` because Go is garbage-collected, and its concurrency model relies on channels and goroutines. For socket addresses, we'll leverage the `net` package.

First, ensure you have Go installed on your system and are familiar with its basic syntax and concurrency model. The `net` package provides a portable interface for network I/O, including TCP/IP, UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets.

```go
package main

import (
   "net"
   "sync"
)

// RemoteMessage is a placeholder for the message type used in the channel.
// Define the RemoteMessage type according to your actual application requirements.
type RemoteMessage struct{}

// MockRemotePlayer represents a mock remote player with a network address and
// a sender channel for RemoteMessage types. The structure of RemoteMessage
// would depend on the specifics of your application.
type MockRemotePlayer struct {
   _address net.Addr
   sender   chan RemoteMessage
}

// NewMockRemotePlayer creates a new instance of MockRemotePlayer with a given address.
// It returns a pointer to MockRemotePlayer. In Go, pointers are commonly used
// to share access to data across boundaries.
func NewMockRemotePlayer(address string) *MockRemotePlayer {
   // Resolve the string address to a net.Addr type. Assume it's TCP for simplicity.
   // Error handling is simplified for brevity. Ensure to handle errors appropriately.
   addr, _ := net.ResolveTCPAddr("tcp", address)

   // Create a channel for RemoteMessages with a buffer of 100, similar to Rust's channel.
   sender := make(chan RemoteMessage, 100)

   // Return a pointer to a new MockRemotePlayer with the resolved address and channel.
   return &MockRemotePlayer{
      _address: addr,
      sender:   sender,
   }
}

func main() {
   // Example usage of NewMockRemotePlayer
   mockPlayer := NewMockRemotePlayer("127.0.0.1:8080")

   // Further operations on mockPlayer can be performed here.
   // For instance, sending a RemoteMessage to the mockPlayer's sender channel.
   // This is a non-blocking send due to the buffered channel, unless the buffer is full.
   mockPlayer.sender <- RemoteMessage{}

   // Assume further logic to utilize mockPlayer.
}
```

This Go version performs similar functionality as your original Rust code: it initializes a new `MockRemotePlayer` with a network address and a sender channel. However, Go's approach to concurrency and memory management differs significantly from Rust's, so while the patterns are similar (i.e., using channels for communication), the underlying mechanics differ (e.g., Go does not use Arc for reference counting because of its garbage collector). Also, note that error handling is simplified here for brevity, but in a real application, you would want to address potential errors, especially those from `net.ResolveTCPAddr`.
