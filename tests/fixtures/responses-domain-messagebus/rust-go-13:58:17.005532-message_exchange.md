on_player_message

```rust
    pub async fn on_player_message(
        client_map: ClientMap,
        player_key: SocketAddr,
        message: RemoteMessage,
    ) {
        let _ = match message {
            RemoteMessage::Pong(who) => client_map.write().await.update_timestamp(&who),
            RemoteMessage::Close(who) => client_map.write().await.remove(who).await,
            RemoteMessage::SendLastState => {
                client_map.read().await.send_last_message(player_key).await
            }
            _ => Self::dispatch_message(client_map, player_key, message).await,
        };
    }
```


Converting the provided Rust code into Go involves understanding the core functionalities and structure of both languages. In Rust, notably with the `tokio` framework (suggested by the usage of `async` and `.await`), asynchronous programming is explicit and integrated into the type system. Go handles concurrency differently, primarily through goroutines and channels, without needing special keywords for most asynchronous operations.

Given the provided Rust code appears to be a part of an async multiplayer game server handling different types of messages from connected players, I'll convert this to Go by creating a similar structure. The conversion will broadly follow Rust's pattern, but adapted to Go's idiomatic patterns, including error handling and goroutine usage for asynchronous operations.

Here's the converted Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	"net"
	"sync"
)

// Assuming definition of RemoteMessage and its types (Pong, Close, SendLastState, etc.) are available

type RemoteMessage interface{}

type Pong struct {
	Who net.Addr
}

type Close struct {
	Who net.Addr
}

type SendLastState struct{}

// ClientMap is a mock definition to represent concurrent map functionality similar to the Rust version.
type ClientMap struct {
	sync.RWMutex // Embedding RWMutex to manage concurrent access.
	// Assuming map and necessary methods like updateTimestamp, remove, and sendLastMessage are defined here.
}

func (c *ClientMap) UpdateTimestamp(who net.Addr) {
	// Placeholder for update timestamp logic
}

func (c *ClientMap) Remove(who net.Addr) {
	// Placeholder for remove logic
}

func (c *ClientMap) SendLastMessage(playerKey net.Addr) {
	// Placeholder for sending last message logic
}

func onPlayerMessage(clientMap *ClientMap, playerKey net.Addr, message RemoteMessage) {
	// Using a goroutine for asynchronous behavior similar to Rust's async.
	go func() {
		// You might need to handle error differently based on your application logic.
		switch msg := message.(type) {
		case Pong:
			clientMap.Lock()
			clientMap.UpdateTimestamp(msg.Who)
			clientMap.Unlock()
		case Close:
			clientMap.Lock()
			clientMap.Remove(msg.Who)
			clientMap.Unlock()
		case SendLastState:
			clientMap.RLock()
			clientMap.SendLastMessage(playerKey)
			clientMap.RUnlock()
		default:
			dispatchMessage(clientMap, playerKey, message)
		}
	}()
}

func dispatchMessage(clientMap *ClientMap, playerKey net.Addr, message RemoteMessage) {
	// Implementation of dispatching the message
}
```

This code reinterprets the async function from Rust into a Go function that uses a goroutine to proceed asynchronously. The `ClientMap` type includes mutex locks to handle concurrent reads/writes, mimicking the thread-safe behavior of Rust's `Arc<Mutex<>>` pattern. In Go, error handling is done with explicit checks, but this skeleton omits detailed error handling for brevity.

Remember, adapting code between languages, especially involving concurrency, requires careful consideration of each language's idiomatic practices and the specific requirements of your application.
