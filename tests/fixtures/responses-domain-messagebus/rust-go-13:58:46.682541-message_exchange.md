To convert the given Rust MessageExchange implementation into Go, we would need to consider several differences between Rust and Go, especially regarding concurrency, error handling, and type system. Rust uses `Arc` for atomic reference counting allowing thread-safe shared mutability, and `RwLock` for read-write locking. Go has built-in concurrency primitives like goroutines and channels, and uses interfaces for dynamic typing.

In this translation, we will map Rust's async/await pattern and Tokio's channels to Go's channels and goroutines. Note that Go does not have a direct equivalent to Tokio's mpsc and broadcast channels; we'll use buffered channels and simulate broadcasting. 

For simplicity, let's assume that the necessary types (`LocalMessage`, `ReceivedRemoteMessage`, `RemoteMessage`, `RemotePlayer`) and functions (`ping_all`, `remove_old_entries`, `update_timestamp`, and others referenced) are defined elsewhere or adapt as needed.

As Go uses explicit interfaces rather than Rust's trait objects (`dyn`), we'll define a `RemotePlayer` interface in Go corresponding to the Rust one. Error handling is also explicit in Go, unlike Rust's `Result` and `Option`.

We're converting just the struct definition and methods because, without the entire surrounding context (e.g., struct definitions for `RemoteMessage`, function definitions for the operations used within these methods), we have to make some assumptions. Also, Go doesn't have async/await syntax; it achieves concurrency through goroutines, so the code structure changes accordingly.

**Go Translation:**

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"net"
	"sync"
	"time"
    "context"

	"golang.org/x/sync/singleflight"
)

// Assume RemotePlayer, LocalMessage, ReceivedRemoteMessage, RemoteMessage, PlayerListItem
// are defined elsewhere.

type MessageExchange struct {
	clientMap     *sync.Map // Concurrent map, alternative to RwLock<HashMap>
	receiver      chan ReceivedRemoteMessage // Simulating broadcast channel using unbuffered channel
	sender        chan ReceivedRemoteMessage // Regular channel
	localSender   chan LocalMessage // Simulating broadcast for local messages
	group         singleflight.Group // For deduping concurrent requests, roughly analogous to using Arc for shared state management in Rust
}

func NewMessageExchange() *MessageExchange {
	me := &MessageExchange{
		clientMap:   new(sync.Map),
		receiver:    make(chan ReceivedRemoteMessage),
		sender:      make(chan ReceivedRemoteMessage, 100),
		localSender: make(chan LocalMessage, 100),
	}

	go me.handleReceivedRemoteMessages()
	go me.checkClients()

	return me
}

func (me *MessageExchange) handleReceivedRemoteMessages() {
	for msg := range me.sender { // Reading from sender channel
		// Would need a way to broadcast, simplified here for example
		me.receiver <- msg

		go me.onPlayerMessage(msg.FromAddress, msg.Message)
	}
}

func (me *MessageExchange) checkClients() {
	for {
		// Assuming CheckClients does something similar
		time.Sleep(15 * time.Second)
	}
}

func (me *MessageExchange) AddPlayer(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
	me.clientMap.Store(key.String(), client)
}

func (me *MessageExchange) AddControl(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
	// Similar to AddPlayer; provided implementation extracted from Rust's add_control
	me.clientMap.Store(key.String(), client)
}

func (me *MessageExchange) Get(key net.Addr) RemotePlayer {
	if val, ok := me.clientMap.Load(key.String()); ok {
		return val.(RemotePlayer)
	}
	return nil
}

func (me *MessageExchange) Remove(key net.Addr) {
	me.clientMap.Delete(key.String())
}

// ListPlayers, OnPlayerMessage, Execute, GetSender/Receiver and other methods would need conversion.
// Given the complexity and to keep this example concise, those are not fully implemented here.

func main() {
    // Example of creating and using MessageExchange
    exchanger := NewMessageExchange()
    // Further operations with `exchanger`
}
```

**Notes:**
- This is a simplified conversion focusing on the core structure and concurrency logic. The detailed implementation (such as error handling, exact message processing logic, and complex interaction patterns) would require more context.
- The Go code showcases basic patterns for converting concurrency primitives and type handling from Rust to Go but does not cover all advanced details. For instance, broadcasting to multiple listeners in Go requires iterating over registered listeners or using a pub/sub system, which isn't directly implemented in this simplified example.
- Error handling in Go is done through explicit checks after each operation that can fail, differing from Rust's pattern matching on `Result` or `Option`.
- Rust’s traits and `dyn` signatures are handled through Go's interfaces, which require methods to be defined explicitly.

Converting complex Rust async code to Go involves careful consideration of how concurrency is managed, as the models and capabilities provided by Tokio/Arc/RwLock in Rust differ from Go's channels and goroutines. Always review and adjust based on specific needs and the broader application context.
