add_player

```rust
    pub async fn add_player(&self, key: SocketAddr, client: Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) {
        self.client_map.write().await.add_player(key, client)
    }
```


To translate this Rust code to Go, we need to understand what it does:

1. It's an asynchronous function (using `async`) which likely belongs to a structure, given the `&self` parameter. This structure seems to manage players in some form of game or application, where each player is represented by or connected through a `SocketAddr` (an IP address and port number).

2. `client_map` appears to be a concurrently accessible structure (`write().await` suggests this is protected by an asynchronous read-write lock), and `add_player` adds a player to this map, identified by `key` with a value `client`. `client` is an `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>`, a reference-counted pointer to a dynamic trait object, indicating polymorphic behavior for `RemotePlayer`.

Given these aspects, here's how it could look in Go, considering Go's approach to concurrency (using channels, mutexes, and the like instead of async-await) and interface-based polymorphism:

```go
package main

import (
	"net"
	"sync"
)

// RemotePlayer defines the interface that must be implemented by remote players.
// This would match the methods defined in your `RemotePlayer` trait in Rust.
type RemotePlayer interface{
    // Define methods that RemotePlayer should have
}

// PlayerManager manages the players connected to the server.
type PlayerManager struct {
	clientMap sync.Map // Provides safe concurrent access without explicit locks
}

// NewPlayerManager creates a new instance of PlayerManager.
func NewPlayerManager() *PlayerManager {
	return &PlayerManager{}
}

// AddPlayer adds a player, identified by their socket address, to the manager.
func (pm *PlayerManager) AddPlayer(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
	// No need to explicitly lock here, as sync.Map handles concurrency.
	pm.clientMap.Store(key, client)
}
```

**Key Differences and Translation Choices:**

- **Interface and Polymorphism**: Go uses interfaces to achieve what Rust does with trait objects. Both achieve a form of dynamic polymorphism but in different language idioms. We define a `RemotePlayer` interface that should mimic the methods of its Rust counterpart.

- **Concurrency**: Instead of async/await, Go uses goroutines and channels or other concurrent types (like `sync.Map` in this case) for concurrency. The `sync.Map` here is safe to use concurrently across multiple goroutines without further synchronization.

- **Error Handling**: The original code does not explicitly handle errors (as part of the snippet provided). In real-world Go code, you would likely deal with potential errors in operations that could fail, as Go encourages explicit error handling.

- **Reference Counting**: Go's garbage collector handles memory management, so there is no direct equivalent to Rust's `Arc` for reference counting. However, Go's interfaces and slices can be passed around efficiently and safely among goroutines, as needed.

This example assumes the existence of a `RemotePlayer` interface in Go that matches the trait in Rust, adapting the concept to Goâ€™s idiomatic approach to polymorphism and concurrency. Ensure any methods required by `RemotePlayer` in your Rust code are defined in the Go interface.
