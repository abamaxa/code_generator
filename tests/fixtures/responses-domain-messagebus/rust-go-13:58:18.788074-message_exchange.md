remove

```rust
    pub async fn remove(&self, key: SocketAddr) {
        self.client_map.write().await.remove(key).await
    }
```


To convert the provided Rust async function into Golang, we should take into account a few differences between the languages:

1. **Concurrency Model**: Rust uses `async/await` pattern for asynchronous programming which is integrated into the language with support from the Futures library. Golang, on the other hand, uses goroutines and channels for concurrency. The `context` package is typically used for cancellation and deadlines.

2. **Error Handling**: Rust has a very explicit error handling model with `Result` and `Option` types, whereas Go embraces errors as return values.

3. **Access Modifiers**: Rust uses `pub` for public functions. In Go, public functions start with an uppercase letter.

4. **Generic Data Structures**: The provided Rust code snippet suggests a map that can be locked for writing (`self.client_map.write().await`). It's similar to using a concurrent map or a structure with a mutex in Go.

5. **Method Definitions**: Go attaches methods to structs using a different syntax than Rust.

Assuming `self.client_map` is a concurrent map in Rust storing `SocketAddr` as keys, we'll need a similar structure in Go, like a map protected by a mutex for thread safety. Given these points, below is an illustrative conversion of the Rust function to Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "net"
    "sync"
)

// Assuming ClientMap represents a struct that holds a map with net.Addr (an interface that SocketAddr would satisfy in Go) as keys.
// This struct would be analogous to your Rust struct that contains client_map.
type ClientMap struct {
    sync.RWMutex // Embedding RWMutex for locking
    clients map[net.Addr]struct{} // Using empty struct as the value type since we're only interested in the keys
}

// NewClientMap creates a new ClientMap.
func NewClientMap() *ClientMap {
    return &ClientMap{
        clients: make(map[net.Addr]struct{}),
    }
}

// Remove is an asynchronous function that removes a client from the map.
func (cm *ClientMap) Remove(addr net.Addr) {
    cm.Lock() // Lock for writing
    defer cm.Unlock() // Ensure we unlock after removal to avoid deadlocks
    
    delete(cm.clients, addr) // Delete the key from the map
}

// Note: In this Go version, we're directly using locking without the equivalent of Rust's async/await. 
// This is because handling such operations in Go is typically done synchronously with explicit locking or by using channels.
```

This Go code snippet assumes the existence of a struct `ClientMap` that holds a map of clients. For the sake of simplicity and direct mapping, we've directly used synchronous locking (`cm.Lock()`) instead of creating an asynchronous structure since Go doesn't have a built-in `async/await` pattern and favors a more straightforward concurrency model based on goroutines and channels. 

Please adjust data types and logic as necessary to fit the exact needs of your application, especially regarding error handling and specific operations on the map.
