get_local_receiver

```rust
    pub fn get_local_receiver(&self) -> LocalMessageReceiver {
        self.local_sender.subscribe()
    }
```


Certainly! Below, I've provided an equivalent implementation in Go, taking into account the differences between Rust and Go's paradigms, libraries, and type systems. Given Rust's type `LocalMessageReceiver` is part of a messaging system where `self.local_sender.subscribe()` likely returns a subscription to receive messages, we'll create a Go version assuming a similar messaging pattern.

In Go, we would typically use channels for messaging between goroutines. Therefore, I'll assume the equivalent function in Go is part of a struct that holds a channel. Since Go does not have a direct equivalent to Rustâ€™s `pub` visibility modifier, the method will be public by making its first letter uppercase. Note, we'll need to tailor the solution based on the specific structure and behavior of `LocalMessageReceiver`.

Go version:

```go
package main

// Importing necessary packages
import (
    "sync"
)

// Assuming the LocalMessageReceiver is a struct in Go which holds a channel of a certain type.
// This type needs to be defined based on your application's specific needs.
type LocalMessageReceiver struct {
    msgChannel <-chan string // Assuming a string message for simplicity, adjust according to your needs.
}

// Assuming a struct that would be equivalent to the Rust struct containing `local_sender`.
type ExampleStruct struct {
    localSender *LocalSender
}

// LocalSender mirrors the functionality that would have been in the original Rust code's `self.local_sender`.
// It holds a channel that will be used to send messages to subscribers.
type LocalSender struct {
    subscribers []chan string // This slice holds all subscriber channels.
    mux         sync.Mutex    // Mutex for safe access to the subscribers slice.
}

// NewLocalSender is a constructor for LocalSender.
func NewLocalSender() *LocalSender {
    return &LocalSender{
        subscribers: make([]chan string, 0),
        mux:         sync.Mutex{},
    }
}

// Subscribe adds a new subscriber and returns a LocalMessageReceiver.
// This method replicates the behavior of `self.local_sender.subscribe()` in Rust.
func (ls *LocalSender) Subscribe() LocalMessageReceiver {
    ls.mux.Lock()
    defer ls.mux.Unlock()

    // Creating a new subscription channel.
    newChannel := make(chan string)
    ls.subscribers = append(ls.subscribers, newChannel)

    // Returning LocalMessageReceiver which wraps the read-only end of the channel.
    return LocalMessageReceiver{msgChannel: newChannel}
}

// GetLocalReceiver translates the Rust method to Go, providing access to a LocalMessageReceiver.
func (es *ExampleStruct) GetLocalReceiver() LocalMessageReceiver {
    // Assuming localSender has been initialized.
    return es.localSender.Subscribe()
}
```

This code sets up a basic pub/sub model in Go, where `LocalSender` can have multiple subscribers each using their own channel to receive messages. The `Subscribe` method creates a new channel, adds it to the list of subscribers, and returns a `LocalMessageReceiver` that wraps the read-only end of the channel. 

Remember, this is a simplified and assumed context based on the original Rust snippet you shared. The actual implementation might need adjustments based on the specific details of `LocalMessageReceiver` and how messaging is intended to work in your application.
