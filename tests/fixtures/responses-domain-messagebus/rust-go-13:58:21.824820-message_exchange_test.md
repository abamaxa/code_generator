test_watch_channels

```rust
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_watch_channels() {
        let (tx, rx) = watch::channel("hello");

        tokio::spawn((|mut rx: Receiver<&'static str>| async move {
            while rx.changed().await.is_ok() {
                println!("listener 1 received = {:?}", *rx.borrow());
            }
        })(rx.clone()));

        tokio::spawn((|mut rx: Receiver<&'static str>| async move {
            while rx.changed().await.is_ok() {
                println!("listener 2 received = {:?}", *rx.borrow());
            }
        })(rx.clone()));

        tx.send("world").unwrap();

        sleep(Duration::from_secs(3)).await;
    }
```


To rewrite the Rust tests using the `tokio` crate into Golang, we will be using Go's concurrency features like goroutines and channels, particularly leveraging the `context` package for cancellation and timeouts, as Go does not have a direct counterpart to Rust's `tokio::watch` channels. Go's standard library offers powerful primitives that can achieve similar functionality.

Here's how you can translate the above Rust test into Golang, with comments explaining each part of the code:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Testing the watchChannels function.
	testWatchChannels()
}

// testWatchChannels mimics the Rust example provided, setting up a scenario to test the broadcasting of a message to multiple listeners.
func testWatchChannels() {
	// Create a context that cancels automatically after 3 seconds to stop the goroutines.
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	// Create a channel for transmitting string values. 
	// Note: This doesn't directly mimic `tokio::watch` as Go doesn't have an exact equivalent.
	msgCh := make(chan string)

	// wg waits for all goroutines to complete their execution.
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Starting two listener goroutines similar to Rust's async blocks in `tokio::spawn`.
	for i := 1; i <= 2; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(listenerID int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			for {
				select {
				case msg, ok := <-msgCh:
					// If the channel is closed and drained, exit the loop.
					if !ok {
						return
					}
					// Print the message received by this listener.
					fmt.Printf("listener %d received = %s\n", listenerID, msg)
				case <-ctx.Done():
					// If the context is done (timeout or cancel), exit the loop.
					return
				}
			}
		}(i)
	}

	// Simulate sending a message to both listeners.
	msgCh <- "hello"
	msgCh <- "world"

	// Close the channel after a slight delay to ensure message broadcast.
	// This mimics sending a message and then closing the channel as done in the provided Rust code.
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		close(msgCh)
	}()

	// Wait for all goroutines to complete before exiting.
	wg.Wait()
}
```

Please note the key differences:
- Rust's `tokio::watch` channel allows for the latest value to be broadcast to multiple consumers and lets them see the same value even if they start listening at different times. In contrast, Go's channels do not retain the last sent value. Once a value is received from a channel, it's gone unless it's specifically stored or broadcasted again.
- The Go version uses a context with a timeout to mimic the delay used in the Rust version for graceful shutdown.
- Synchronization is managed using a WaitGroup to ensure that the main function waits for all goroutines to finish executing before exiting.

Keep in mind that while this Go version aims to replicate the behavior demonstrated in the Rust code, the differences in language features and concurrency models mean the translation isn't one-to-one but rather adapted to idiomatic Go.
