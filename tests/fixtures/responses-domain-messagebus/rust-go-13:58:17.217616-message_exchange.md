add_control

```rust
    pub async fn add_control(&self, key: SocketAddr, client: Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) {
        self.client_map.write().await.add_control(key, client);
    }
```


To rewrite the provided Rust asynchronous function into Golang, we need to consider several aspects. First, Rust and Go handle concurrency differently. Rust uses `async/await` pattern, and Go uses goroutines along with channels. Secondly, Rust's `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>` suggests that `RemotePlayer` is a trait (interface in Go terms) implemented by the type referenced by `Arc`, providing thread-safe reference-counting. In Go, interfaces are implicitly satisfied and we use pointer receivers to pass structs around in a memory-efficient and concurrent-safe manner when necessary.

Given these considerations, we'll make a few assumptions for the Go code:

1. There's a `ClientMap` struct in Go with an `AddControl` method that is equivalent to Rust's `client_map.add_control`.
2. We assume the equivalent of `SocketAddr` in Go is `net.Addr`, a common interface for network addresses.
3. We assume there's a `RemotePlayer` interface in Go with methods that the concrete type should implement.
4. Since Go does not have built-in "futures" or "async/await" mechanisms like Rust, operations that might block (such as locking a mutex) do not return a "future" or require "await". Instead, they simply block the goroutine they're running in, which is lightweight.

Here's how the translation might look like in Go, including helpful comments:

```go
package main

import (
    "net"
    "sync"
)

// Assume RemotePlayer is an interface with methods that must be implemented by any struct that represents a remote player.
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // Methods that the implementing struct must have
}

// Assume ClientMap is a struct that contains a map or another form of collection to manage clients.
type ClientMap struct {
    sync.RWMutex  // Embedding RWMutex to handle concurrent read/write access.
    // other fields as necessary, e.g., a map to store client data
}

// AddControl adds a new control (client) to the ClientMap.
// This method should be safe to call from multiple goroutines.
func (cm *ClientMap) AddControl(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
    cm.Lock()         // Lock before modifying the map to ensure thread safety.
    defer cm.Unlock() // Ensure the lock is released after modifying the map.
    // Assume we have a method or logic here to actually add the key and client to the underlying collection.
}

// YourStruct should be the receiver of the method we're converting. It contains a ClientMap.
type YourStruct struct {
    ClientMap *ClientMap
}

// AddControl is a method on YourStruct to add a control (client) associated with a key.
// It wraps around the ClientMap's AddControl for convenient access.
func (ys *YourStruct) AddControl(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
    // Simply delegate to the ClientMap's AddControl method.
    // This operation is likely to block until the lock in AddControl can be acquired, but this is handled gracefully by Go's scheduler.
    ys.ClientMap.AddControl(key, client)
}
```

In this Go version, I've made some necessary assumptions as the direct porting of certain constructs is not feasible due to language differences. I included comments within the code to explain what each section is responsible for and to highlight Go-specific concurrency management through mutex locks.
