check_clients

```rust
    pub async fn check_clients(client_map: ClientMap) {
        client_map.read().await.ping_all().await;

        sleep(Duration::from_secs(15)).await;

        client_map
            .write()
            .await
            .remove_old_entries(SystemTime::now().sub(Duration::from_secs(90)))
            .await;
    }
```


To rewrite your Rust async function into Go, we'll assume the `ClientMap` equivalent in Go is a type that provides thread-safe access to its data, similar to what a `RwLock` does in Rust. In Go, such thread-safety can be achieved using `sync.RWMutex` along with the struct that holds your clients' data.

Let's assume `ClientMap` in Go is a struct that contains a map of clients and an `RWMutex` for managing concurrent access. The equivalent Go method would perform similar operations: reading from the map to ping all clients, sleeping for a while, and then writing to the map to remove old entries.

Below is an example rewrite in Go. This example presumes the existence of some methods (`PingAll()` and `RemoveOldEntries()`) and types (`ClientMap`) that would need to be defined in your Go implementation based on your program's specific requirements.

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// ClientMap is a presumptive type that holds your clients and provides thread-safe operations on them.
type ClientMap struct {
	sync.RWMutex
	// Assuming the actual map or data structure holding the clients is within this struct.
	// For instance, it might be something like: clients map[string]*Client
}

// NewClientMap creates a new instance of ClientMap.
func NewClientMap() *ClientMap {
	return &ClientMap{
		// Initialize your client map or any other necessary fields here.
	}
}

// PingAll is a placeholder for the method that would iterate over all clients and ping them.
func (cm *ClientMap) PingAll() {
	// Logic to ping all clients.
	// This method should be safe for concurrent reads.
}

// RemoveOldEntries removes clients that have not been active for a certain duration.
func (cm *ClientMap) RemoveOldEntries(duration time.Duration) {
	// Logic to remove old entries.
	// This method needs to acquire a write lock to modify the client map safely.
}

// CheckClients performs the operations similar to your Rust code: it pings all clients, sleeps for a specified duration, 
// and then removes old entries.
func CheckClients(cm *ClientMap) {
	// First, we acquire a read lock to ping all clients concurrently.
	cm.RLock()
	cm.PingAll()
	cm.RUnlock()

	// Sleep for 15 seconds.
	time.Sleep(15 * time.Second)

	// Now, we need to remove old entries, which requires exclusive access, so we use a write lock.
	cm.Lock()
	cm.RemoveOldEntries(90 * time.Second)
	cm.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	clientMap := NewClientMap()
	// Assuming we're calling CheckClients in a way that suits the application, possibly in its own goroutine.
	go CheckClients(clientMap)

	// The main function might do other work or start a server.
	// For simplicity, we're just waiting indefinitely here.
	select {}
}
```

A few critical points in this conversion:

1. **Concurrency:** Go uses goroutines and channels for concurrency. The `RWMutex` is used here to manage read and write access to the map concurrently, similar to Rust's `async`/`await` mechanism with `RwLock`.

2. **Error Handling:** Go handles errors differently than Rust, which uses `Result` and `Option` types. Go's approach is more straightforward, with functions often returning an error value that can be checked. This example does not detail error handling for simplicity, but you should incorporate it as necessary for methods like `PingAll()` and `RemoveOldEntries()`.

3. **Lifetime and Borrowing:** Rust's borrowing and ownership aren't concepts in Go. Go's garbage collector handles memory management, making it easier in some respects but also removing some of Rust's guarantees against data races.

Please adjust the example based on your actual `ClientMap` structure and logic within `PingAll()` and `RemoveOldEntries()` for a complete and functional conversion.
