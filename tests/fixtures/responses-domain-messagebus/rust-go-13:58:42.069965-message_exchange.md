get_local_sender

```rust
    pub fn get_local_sender(&self) -> LocalMessageSender {
        self.local_sender.clone()
    }
```


To translate the provided Rust code into Go, it's necessary to first understand the purpose and structure of the Rust code, and then implement a similar functionality in Go, considering the differences in how the two languages handle concepts such as concurrency, object-oriented programming, and error handling.

The Rust code looks like a method of a struct that returns a clone of a `LocalMessageSender`. This `LocalMessageSender` could be a custom type or struct that is responsible for sending messages locally within the application, possibly within the same process or thread. Rust's `clone()` method is used to create a copy of `local_sender`, ensuring that the original sender is not modified or moved, adhering to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.

To translate this to Go, a few assumptions and modifications are necessary due to inherent differences in language design:

1. In Go, there's no direct equivalent to Rust's `clone()` method for all types, as Go handles variable assignment and passing differently. If `LocalMessageSender` in Go is a pointer to a struct (which is common for mutable or stateful structs in Go), simply passing the pointer around would suffice for most cases where shallow copying is acceptable.

2. Go does not have classes or methods in the same way Rust does. Instead, it has structs and attached methods. The method definition does not explicitly belong to a struct through a `self` keyword but is attached to a receiver of a specific type.

3. Go uses receivers in method definitions to associate a function with a type, which can be thought of as the method's "owner". The receiver can be a value or a pointer.

Below is a Go version of your Rust function, with comments. This example assumes `LocalMessageSender` is a struct. The translation might handle copying based on whether `LocalMessageSender` needs deep cloning that Go doesn't inherently support for all types. The translation assumes a shallow copy suffices or the type is such that copying the reference (if it's a pointer) is the desired behavior:

```go
package main

// Assuming LocalMessageSender is a defined struct somewhere in your Go code.
type LocalMessageSender struct {
    // fields here
}

// Assuming a struct that holds our LocalMessageSender, similar to your Rust example
type MyStruct struct {
    localSender *LocalMessageSender // Using a pointer assuming mutable state is held
}

// GetLocalSender is a method on MyStruct that returns a reference (pointer) to LocalMessageSender.
// In Go, simply returning the pointer allows the caller to use LocalMessageSender, similar to Rust's cloning in this context.
// Note: If LocalMessageSender contains mutable state and you need to actually clone it (deep copy),
// you'll need a custom method on LocalMessageSender to create and return that deep copy based on your specific needs.
func (m *MyStruct) GetLocalSender() *LocalMessageSender {
    // Simply return the pointer for a shallow copy. Modify this if a deep copy logic is needed.
    return m.localSender
}

// example usage
func main() {
    // Example initialization and usage
    sender := &LocalMessageSender{
        // initialize your structure
    }
    myStruct := MyStruct{
        localSender: sender,
    }
    localSender := myStruct.GetLocalSender()
    // Now you can use localSender...
}
```

This Go example adheres to typical Go patterns and assumes a shallow copy (i.e., copying the pointer) suffices for your use case. If the `LocalMessageSender` must be deeply cloned, you'll have to implement that logic, as Go does not provide a generic `clone()` method like Rust.
