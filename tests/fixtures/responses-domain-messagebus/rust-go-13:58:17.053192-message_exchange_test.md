MockRemotePlayer

```rust
    struct MockRemotePlayer {
        _address: SocketAddr,
        sender: Sender<RemoteMessage>,
    }
```


To begin the conversion of the Rust struct to Go, we will also translate the concept of a mock remote player into the Go paradigm, considering the struct definition you provided. In Go, a struct is also used to create complex types. However, there are some differences in syntax and capabilities compared to Rust.

Given the `MockRemotePlayer` struct in Rust which consists of a `_address` field of type `SocketAddr` and a `sender` field of type `Sender<RemoteMessage>`, the translation to Go would involve figuring out equivalent types and functionalities.

Here's how you might start by converting the Rust struct into a Go struct, taking into account Go's type system and struct declaration syntax:

```go
package main

import (
	"net" // For using net.Addr, which is similar to SocketAddr in Rust.
	"chan" // Note: this is pseudo-code, as Go's channels are built-in and do not require an import.
)

// RemoteMessage is a placeholder for whatever type you're sending over the channels,
// You'll need to define this based on the actual data structure you're working with.
// Here's an example assuming RemoteMessage is just a string for simplicity.
type RemoteMessage string

// MockRemotePlayer mocks a remote player for testing.
// In Go, the convention is to not prepend underscores to unused fields,
// but if the address isn't directly used, you might omit it or comment on its purpose.
type MockRemotePlayer struct {
	address net.Addr        // Replacing SocketAddr. net.Addr is an interface that net.IP implements.
	sender  chan RemoteMessage // Channels in Go are used for communication between goroutines similar to Sender in Rust.
}

// NewMockRemotePlayer creates a new instance of MockRemotePlayer.
// This function takes an address and a sender channel and returns a new MockRemotePlayer.
// This is a common pattern in Go to encapsulate initialization of structs.
func NewMockRemotePlayer(address net.Addr, sender chan RemoteMessage) *MockRemotePlayer {
	return &MockRemotePlayer{
		address: address,
		sender:  sender,
	}
}

// main function for demonstration purposes.
// This is where you'd typically instantiate MockRemotePlayer and use it.
func main() {
	// Example usage of NewMockRemotePlayer
	var addr net.Addr // Assuming this would be an actual network address in real code.
	sender := make(chan RemoteMessage) // Creating a new channel for RemoteMessage types.

	mockPlayer := NewMockRemotePlayer(addr, sender)
	_ = mockPlayer // To illustrate that mockPlayer is being used, normally you'd do something with mockPlayer here.
}
```

This Go example attempts to mirror the structure and purpose of your Rust struct. Note that in Go, the convention is to use readable and descriptive names, and thereâ€™s no need to signify unused variables with underscores as is sometimes done in Rust. Additionally, since Go does not have generics in the same way that Rust does (as of Go versions before 1.18), the type of messages that the channel can send or receive must be defined explicitly.
