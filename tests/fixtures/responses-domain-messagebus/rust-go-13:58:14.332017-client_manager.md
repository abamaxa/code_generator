get_clients

```rust
    pub fn get_clients(&self, exclude: SocketAddr) -> Vec<Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>> {
        self.inner
            .iter()
            .filter_map(|(key, item)| {
                if *key != exclude {
                    Some(item.client.clone())
                } else {
                    None
                }
            })
            .collect()
    }
```


To convert the given Rust function to Go, it's important to understand its purpose and structure. This function filters and collects clients from a data structure, excluding a specific client based on its socket address. Assuming the equivalent data structures in Go, the conversion requires some adjustments, especially because Go doesn't have generics in the same way Rust does (as of the knowledge cut-off in 2023) and handles concurrency differently (e.g., Rust's `Arc` for atomic reference counting). We'll use interfaces and slices to achieve a similar result.

First, we need to define or understand the equivalent of `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>` in Go. Assuming we have an interface `RemotePlayer` defined somewhere in our Go code, and a structure that holds clients similarly to how it's described in Rust. We might have something like below as the Go equivalent.

```go
package main

import (
    "net"
    "sync"
)

// RemotePlayer is an interface that must be satisfied by any remote player.
// Assume it has necessary methods defined here.
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // Method signatures that remote players must implement.
}

// ClientHolder represents a simplified version of the Rust's self.
// It holds clients in a thread-safe manner, using a mutex for synchronisation.
type ClientHolder struct {
    mu     sync.Mutex
    clients map[net.Addr]*RemotePlayer
}

// GetClients returns a slice of RemotePlayer interfaces, excluding the one with the provided address.
func (ch *ClientHolder) GetClients(exclude net.Addr) []RemotePlayer {
    // Locking the mutex to safely access the clients map.
    ch.mu.Lock()
    defer ch.mu.Unlock() // Ensures the lock is released when function execution is done.

    var filteredClients []RemotePlayer

    for addr, client := range ch.clients {
        if addr.String() != exclude.String() {
            // Dereferencing the pointer to match the Rust's clone,
            // assuming a deep copy isn't necessary or is handled differently in Go.
            filteredClients = append(filteredClients, *client)
        }
    }

    return filteredClients
}
```

### Explanation

- **Mutex for Synchronization**: Unlike Rust, which uses `Arc` for thread-safe reference counting, Go uses mutexes for synchronizing access to shared resources.
- **Map instead of iter.filter_map**: Given Go's different approach to error handling and iteration, a loop through the map is more idiomatic than trying to replicate `filter_map` directly.
- **Slices for Vec**: Go's slice type is a flexible and powerful interface to sequences of data, somewhat like Rust's `Vec`, but with differences in memory management and capabilities.
- **Interfaces for Dynamic Dispatch**: This example uses Go interfaces to achieve polymorphism. It's assumed that `RemotePlayer` is an interface that any remote player structs would implement.
- **Explicit Mutex Locking and Unlocking**: Since Go does not have RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) like Rust, we need to explicitly lock and defer the unlocking of the mutex for thread-safe operations.

This conversion simplifies error handling (assuming that retrieving the client just works or panicking/error handling is done elsewhere) and dynamically gathers clients, excluding a specific one. It should be adapted to your specific use case, especially considering how you handle errors and the specific methods `RemotePlayer` needs to implement.
