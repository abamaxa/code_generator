Client

```rust
impl Client {
    pub fn new_player(client: &Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) -> Self {
        Self {
            client: client.clone(),
            role: ClientRole::Player,
            timestamp: SystemTime::now(),
            last_message: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn new_remote_control(client: &Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) -> Self {
        Self {
            client: client.clone(),
            role: ClientRole::RemoteControl,
            timestamp: SystemTime::now(),
            last_message: None,
        }
    }
}
```


To convert the provided Rust code to Go, we need to understand what the code is doing.

In Rust, the code snippet is inside an implementation block for a `Client` struct, providing two constructor methods for creating a new `Client` instance as a player or remote control. The `Client` struct seems to reference a `RemotePlayer` trait (possibly a trait for client communications), holds a `ClientRole` enum to differentiate the type of client (`Player` or `RemoteControl`), tracks a `timestamp` of the client's creation or another significant event, and possibly the time of the last message sent or received with `last_message`.

Given that Go does not have classes or traits as in Rust, a similar pattern can be established using interfaces and struct types. The concept of `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>` in Rust, which provides thread-safe reference counting for shared ownership of a value of type `RemotePlayer`, translates to using pointer or interface types directly in Go, given Go's built-in garbage collection and concurrent programming features.

Below is an attempt to rewrite the provided Rust code into Go. Note that some assumptions are made, such as the exact nature of `RemotePlayer`, `ClientRole`, and absence of detailed `Client` struct definition in Rust.

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// RemotePlayer is an interface representing the methods that a remote player should implement.
// This is an assumed interface since the actual methods of RemotePlayer were not provided.
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // Methods that a remote player should have e.g.,
    SendMessage(message string) error
}

// ClientRole is an enum to differentiate the role of a client.
type ClientRole int

const (
    Player ClientRole = iota
    RemoteControl
)

// Client represents a client with a role, a reference to a remote player, and timestamps for creation and last message.
type Client struct {
    client       RemotePlayer // Assuming `client` is the remote player interface.
    role         ClientRole
    timestamp    time.Time // Using Go's time.Time for time-stamping.
    lastMessage  *time.Time // Optional last message time, nil if no message yet.
}

// NewPlayer creates a new Client instance with the role of Player.
func NewPlayer(client RemotePlayer) *Client {
    return &Client{
        client:    client,
        role:      Player,
        timestamp: time.Now(),
    }
}

// NewRemoteControl creates a new Client instance with the role of RemoteControl.
func NewRemoteControl(client RemotePlayer) *Client {
    return &Client{
        client:    client,
        role:      RemoteControl,
        timestamp: time.Now(),
    }
}

func main() {
    // Example usage: assuming `someRemotePlayer` is an implementation of the RemotePlayer interface.
    // playerClient := NewPlayer(someRemotePlayer)
    // remoteControlClient := NewRemoteControl(someRemotePlayer)
}
```

This Go version mirrors the functionality of the original Rust code. It uses interfaces (`RemotePlayer`) to achieve a level of abstraction similar to Rust's traits, employs a struct (`Client`) for holding client details, and `ClientRole` enum (implemented using `iota` for simplicity) to distinguish between player and remote controller roles. We've also taken into consideration that Go has automatic garbage collection, thus not requiring manual reference counting like in Rust with `Arc`. However, specific details, especially around `RemotePlayer`, are assumed for demonstration purposes.
