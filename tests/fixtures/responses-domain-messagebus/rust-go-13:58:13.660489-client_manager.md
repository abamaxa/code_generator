update_last_message

```rust
    pub fn update_last_message(&mut self, addr: &SocketAddr, message: RemoteMessage) {
        let new_time = SystemTime::now();
        self.inner.get_mut(addr).map(|client| {
            client.timestamp = new_time;
            client.last_message = Some(message);
        });
    }
```


To translate the provided Rust function into Go, there are several points to consider. Rust's `SocketAddr` can be represented using Go's `net.Addr`, and the concept of mutability with ownership is handled differently in Go, relying on pointer semantics. Additionally, Go doesn't have a direct equivalent to Rust's `Option` type for `client.last_message`, but using pointer semantics or explicitly handling the "zero" value case can serve as an alternative. For time management, Go's `time` package can be used similarly.

Given these considerations, let's translate the provided Rust function into a Go method, assuming a struct similar to what's implied by the Rust code. Note that in Go, structs typically don't contain business logic directly but interact through functions or methods defined on them.

First, we'll define the equivalent Go structures, assuming `RemoteMessage` is another struct you want to translate. For simplicity, this translation will treat `RemoteMessage` as a straightforward struct that you would implement based on the Rust version's definition.

Rust equivalent types (included for clarity):
```rust
struct Client {
    timestamp: SystemTime,
    last_message: Option<RemoteMessage>,
}

struct YourStruct {
    inner: HashMap<SocketAddr, Client>,
}
```

Go version:
```go
package main

import (
	"net"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// Assuming RemoteMessage is a struct you're also converting from Rust.
type RemoteMessage struct {
	// Your fields here.
}

// Client mirrors the Rust client struct, with timestamp and pointer to the last message.
type Client struct {
	Timestamp   time.Time
	LastMessage *RemoteMessage
}

type YourStruct struct {
	mutex sync.RWMutex
	Inner map[net.Addr]*Client
}

// UpdateLastMessage updates the last message received from a given address.
func (y *YourStruct) UpdateLastMessage(addr net.Addr, message RemoteMessage) {
	y.mutex.Lock() // Because maps are not safe for concurrent use.
	defer y.mutex.Unlock()
	
	if client, ok := y.Inner[addr]; ok {
		newTime := time.Now()
		client.Timestamp = newTime
		client.LastMessage = &message // Using pointer to RemoteMessage.
	}
}
```

This Go code takes into account thread safety with `sync.RWMutex`, ensuring that concurrent writes to the map `Inner` are safely handledâ€”a concern implicitly managed in the Rust snippet via the borrow checker and ownership system, which isn't directly paralleled in Go. Note that this Go code assumes initialization of `YourStruct` somewhere in your program with `Inner` appropriately initialized as a map, and `net.Addr` is used as a flexible stand-in for Rust's `SocketAddr`. 

Please adapt `RemoteMessage` and other types or functionality as needed based on your specific Rust to Go translation requirements.
