execute

```rust
    pub async fn execute(
        &self,
        key: SocketAddr,
        command: RemoteMessage,
    ) -> (StatusCode, Json<Response>) {
        // hold the lock for as short a time as possible.
        let remote_client = match self.get(key).await {
            Some(client) => client,
            _ => {
                return (
                    StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST,
                    Json(Response::error("no players have connected yet".to_string())),
                )
            }
        };

        // send the command over a websocket to be received by a browser, which should
        // execute the command.
        match remote_client.send(command).await {
            Ok(result) => (result, Json(Response::success("success".to_string()))),
            Err(e) => (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, Json(Response::error(e))),
        }
    }
```


Translating the provided Rust async function `execute` into Go requires several adjustments due to differences in language features like error handling, asynchrony handling, and types. Rust's pattern matching isn't directly available in Go; instead, we use conditional statements. The `tokio` async runtime in Rust is replaced with Go's built-in concurrency features, like goroutines and channels. Rust's `Result` and `Option` types are translated into idiomatic Go error handling. We'll also convert the `StatusCode`, `Json<Response>` types, and `RemoteMessage` types to their Go equivalents. Note that Go doesn't have an equivalent of `StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST` directly in the standard library, so we'll use the `net/http` package statuses.

Given these differences, here's a Go version of your Rust code, including comments to describe the code:

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "errors"
    "net"
    "net/http"
)

// Assuming the Response type exists in Go and has success and error methods as in Rust.
type Response struct {
    // fields and methods omitted for brevity
}

func (r *Response) success(message string) *Response {
    // logic to create a success response
    return r
}

func (r *Response) error(message string) *Response {
    // logic to create an error response
    return r
}

// RemoteMessage should be defined based on how it's used in Rust.
type RemoteMessage struct {
    // fields and methods omitted for brevity
}

// Assuming RemoteClient mirrors the necessary method in Rust.
type RemoteClient struct {
    // fields and methods omitted for brevity
}

func (rc *RemoteClient) send(command RemoteMessage) error {
    // logic to send a command, simulating async sending
    return nil
}

type MyType struct {
    // Assuming this contains a method get akin to Rust's.
    // fields and methods omitted for brevity
}

func (s *MyType) get(key net.Addr) (*RemoteClient, error) {
    // logic to get a RemoteClient based on the key
    return &RemoteClient{}, nil
}

func (s *MyType) execute(key net.Addr, command RemoteMessage) (int, *Response) {
    // As close as possible mimic of the Rust async function using Go's idiomatic error handling
    remoteClient, err := s.get(key)
    if err != nil {
        // Simulating StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST with http.StatusBadRequest
        return http.StatusBadRequest, new(Response).error("no players have connected yet")
    }

    // Attempt to send the command, mimicking async behavior using goroutines if necessary
    err = remoteClient.send(command)
    if err != nil {
        return http.StatusInternalServerError, new(Response).error(err.Error())
    }

    return http.StatusOK, new(Response).success("success")
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    myType := MyType{}
    key := net.IPAddr{} // Just as a placeholder, should be appropriately initialized
    command := RemoteMessage{}
    status, response := myType.execute(&key, command)
    responseJSON, _ := json.Marshal(response) // Ignoring error for brevity
    println(status, string(responseJSON))
}
```

This code represents the general approach to translating the given Rust function into Go, including error handling, basic type definitions, and a simplified concurrency model. Keep in mind, without full context, certain assumptions were made, particularly about the types like `RemoteMessage`, `Response`, and `RemoteClient`, their methods, and how they are implemented. The use of pointers, error handling, and JSON serialization are idiomatic to Go. Adjustments might be required based on the actual use case and context.
