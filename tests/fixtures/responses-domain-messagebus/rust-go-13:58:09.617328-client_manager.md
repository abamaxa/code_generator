update_timestamp

```rust
    pub fn update_timestamp(&mut self, addr: &SocketAddr) {
        let new_time = SystemTime::now();
        self.inner
            .get_mut(addr)
            .map(|client| client.timestamp = new_time);
    }
```


To rewrite the provided Rust code to Go, consider the Rust code is part of a struct implementation that tracks clients and their last interaction timestamp. The `update_timestamp` function updates the timestamp for a client identified by a `SocketAddr`.

Given that context, here's how one might translate this function into Go, maintaining the same functionalities but considering Go's standard library and idioms:

```go
package main

import (
	"net"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// Client represents a client with an associated timestamp
type Client struct {
	Timestamp time.Time
}

// ClientTracker tracks clients' last interaction timestamps
type ClientTracker struct {
	mu    sync.Mutex // ensures concurrent access to the clients map is safe
	inner map[string]Client
}

// NewClientTracker creates a new ClientTracker instance
func NewClientTracker() *ClientTracker {
	return &ClientTracker{
		inner: make(map[string]Client),
	}
}

// UpdateTimestamp updates the timestamp for a given client address
func (c *ClientTracker) UpdateTimestamp(addr *net.UDPAddr) {
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()

	newTime := time.Now()
	if client, exists := c.inner[addr.String()]; exists {
		client.Timestamp = newTime
		c.inner[addr.String()] = client // update the map with the new timestamp
		// Note: In Go, map values are not addressable, so we can't directly modify the timestamp in the map
		// This is why we need to retrieve the value, modify it, and then put it back into the map
	}
}
```

Explanation:

- The function was part of a struct (implied by `&mut self`). In Go, struct methods are defined with a receiver. `ClientTracker` substitutes for our imaginary struct.
- A `sync.Mutex` is used to ensure that concurrent access to the `inner` map is thread-safe. This is necessary since Go does not have built-in immutability (as Rust does with its ownership system), and maps are not safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines without synchronization.
- Go does not have a direct equivalent to Rust's `Option::map`, so an existence check (`if exists { ... }`) is used after attempting to fetch the client from the map.
- Time handling is directly done using `time.Now` in both languages, but assignment back to a map is slightly more verbose in Go due to the map values being non-addressable.
- The `addr.String()` method is used to convert the `*net.UDPAddr` to a `string` as map keys in Go can't be complex struct types like `net.UDPAddr` without custom implementations of hash and equality functions. Converting to a string is the simplest approach for this example.
