The Rust code you've provided seems to be part of a larger context or a struct implementation, dealing with asynchronous message exchange using channels and managing client states in a concurrent environment, specifically using tokio for async operations and channels for communication. Now, converting this to Go will involve using Go's concurrency patterns, like goroutines, channels, and possibly sync package for concurrency-safe operations (similar to Rust's `Arc<RwLock<>>` for shared state). 

However, there are a few Rust-specific constructs (like `Arc`, `RwLock`, `mpsc`, and `broadcast` channels) and custom types (`MessengerMap`, `ReceivedRemoteMessage`, `ClientMap`, `LocalMessage`, `MessageExchange`) in the snippet which don't have direct equivalents in Go or require context to appropriately translate (e.g., the structure of `ReceivedRemoteMessage`). For the purpose of this translation, I'll assume these types and their methods behave similarly to their names and provide a skeleton Go code that matches the concurrency pattern seen in your Rust code, including comments to describe the intent.

Given this is a simplified translation, some Rust concepts will be approximated in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"

    "golang.org/x/sync/errgroup"
)

// Assuming ReceivedRemoteMessage struct.
type ReceivedRemoteMessage struct {
    FromAddress string
    Message     string
}

// Assuming LocalMessage struct.
type LocalMessage struct{}

// Assuming MessengerMap is similar to a map and thread-safe.
type MessengerMap struct {
    sync.RWMutex // Embedding for thread-safety.
    // Map data structure, adjust accordingly.
}

// NewMessengerMap creates a new, empty MessengerMap.
func NewMessengerMap() *MessengerMap {
    return &MessengerMap{}
    // initialize map structure inside.
}


// MessageExchange is expected to have methods similar to those mentioned in Rust code.
type MessageExchange struct {
    // Assuming fields based on the usage in the Rust snippet.
}

// New creates a new instance of the MessageExchange including setting up all necessary channels and goroutines.
func New() *MessageExchange {
    clientMap := &MessengerMap{} // Or however MessengerMap is initialized.
    ctx := context.Background()
    g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(ctx)

    // Similar to Rust's mpsc::channel; buffered channel for ReceivedRemoteMessage.
    receivedMessages := make(chan ReceivedRemoteMessage, 100)

    // Similar to Rust's broadcast channel; using native Go channel as an approximation.
    broadcast := make(chan ReceivedRemoteMessage, 1)

    // Golang doesn't have a direct broadcast mechanism like Tokio, so consumers will need to ensure they can keep up or use a different pattern.

    g.Go(func() error {
        // This goroutine simulates receiving messages and broadcasting them.
        for {
            select {
            case msg := <-receivedMessages:
                // Simulate broadcast; error handling can be more complex.
                select {
                case broadcast <- msg:
                default: // If receiver isn't ready, we drop the message or handle it otherwise.
                    fmt.Printf("could not send remote message: %+v\n", msg)
                }
                
                // Replicating the behavior of calling a static method `on_player_message`.
                // Assuming OnPlayerMessage exists and is relevant in our Go port.
                MessageExchange{}.OnPlayerMessage(*clientMap, msg.FromAddress, msg.Message)
            case <-ctx.Done():
                return ctx.Err()
            }
        }
    })

    // Setting up another goroutine as per Rust's spawn for check_clients.
    // Assuming a function CheckClients exists on MessageExchange and is relevant.
    g.Go(func() error {
        for {
            select {
            case <-time.After(time.Second): // Assuming some frequency to check clients.
                MessageExchange{}.CheckClients(*clientMap)
            case <-ctx.Done():
                return ctx.Err()
            }
        }
    })

    // Simplifying: return type here to show method signature context,
    // but in practice, you may need to adjust based on actual instance creation and return.
    exchanger := MessageExchange{}

    // OMITTED: Error handling for g.Wait() if needed, based on errgroup usage and your error strategy.

    return &exchanger
}
```

This Go code attempts to capture the concurrency and channel-based communication patterns from your Rust example. Note, direct "broadcast" as in Tokio's publish-subscribe pattern is not directly available in Go, so typically a different approach is used for that pattern or custom implementations are provided. Moreover, in real use, you would need to flesh out types like `ReceivedRemoteMessage`, `MessengerMap`, their method implementations, and how `MessageExchange` methods like `OnPlayerMessage` and `CheckClients` are supposed to work. 

Remember, Go's concurrency model and patterns may lead to different design decisions compared to Rust, so this translation aims to stay conceptually similar rather than providing a line-by-line exact replica.
