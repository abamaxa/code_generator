add_control

```rust
    pub fn add_control(&mut self, key: SocketAddr, client: Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) {
        self.inner.insert(key, Client::new_remote_control(&client));
    }
```


To convert the provided Rust code snippet to Go, first, we need to understand what it does in Rust:

- This is a method called `add_control` on a struct (not shown in the snippet), which takes a mutable reference to `self`, a `SocketAddr` (likely representing an IP address and port), and a client of type `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>` (a thread-safe reference-counted pointer to an object implementing the `RemotePlayer` trait).
- It inserts the `client` into `self.inner` (likely a collection such as a HashMap) with `key` as the key, after wrapping it with `Client::new_remote_control` which presumably creates a new `Client` object that acts as a remote control wrapper around the `client`.

To convert this to Go, we need to make several adjustments due to differences in language features and idioms:

1. Rust traits and `Arc` pointers do not have direct equivalents in Go. The closest thing to `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>` would be an interface type pointer in Go for polymorphism, and concurrency safety would rely on Go's concurrency mechanisms, like channels or mutexes.
2. Go does not have constructors in the same way Rust does. The `new_remote_control` function would typically be replaced with a constructor-like function in Go.
3. Go's methods on structs are defined a bit differently, and Go does not have a direct equivalent of Rust's `&mut self` for method receivers. We would typically use a pointer receiver to modify the struct in Go.

Assuming we have a `Client` struct and a `RemotePlayer` interface in Go, as well as a struct (let's call it `Controller`) with an `inner` field that's a map (`map[net.Addr]*Client`), the conversion might look like this:

```go
package controller

import (
    "net"
    "sync"
)

// RemotePlayer is an interface representing a remote player,
// mirroring the Rust trait RemotePlayer.
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // Define methods that RemotePlayer needs to implement here.
}

// Client represents a client connected to the server.
type Client struct {
    // Assume fields that represent a client's state here
}

// NewRemoteControl constructs a new Client acting as a remote control for a RemotePlayer.
func NewRemoteControl(player RemotePlayer) *Client {
    // Logic to create a new Client from a RemotePlayer
    return &Client{
        // Initialize fields here
    }
}

// Controller manages clients and their associated connections.
type Controller struct {
    inner map[net.Addr]*Client
    mu    sync.Mutex // Adding mutex to handle concurrency,
}

// NewController creates a new Controller instance.
func NewController() *Controller {
    return &Controller{
        inner: make(map[net.Addr]*Client),
    }
}

// AddControl inserts a new client into the Controller's map,
// making sure to lock for concurrency safety.
func (c *Controller) AddControl(key net.Addr, client RemotePlayer) {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()
    c.inner[key] = NewRemoteControl(client)
}
```

Notes:
- The `sync.Mutex` is used to ensure that access to the `inner` map is safe across multiple goroutines.
- We used pointers (`*Controller`) for the method receiver to mutate the instance's state, similar to Rust's `&mut self`.
- `net.Addr` is a Go standard library interface used for network addresses, which can serve a similar purpose as `SocketAddr` in Rust.
- Go does not have automatic reference counting like Rust's `Arc`. Depending on the exact ownership and lifetime requirements of `RemotePlayer` instances, you might need to carefully manage their lifetimes to avoid memory leaks or use reference counting libraries that exist in the Go ecosystem.
