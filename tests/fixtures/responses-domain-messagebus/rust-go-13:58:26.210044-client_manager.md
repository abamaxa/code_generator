ping_all

```rust
    pub async fn ping_all(&self) {
        let ping_msg = match SystemTime::now().duration_since(SystemTime::UNIX_EPOCH) {
            Ok(n) => n.as_secs(),
            Err(_) => 1,
        };

        let message = RemoteMessage::Ping(ping_msg);

        let mut js = JoinSet::new();
        for item in self.inner.values() {
            js.spawn(
                (|client: Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>, message: RemoteMessage| async move {
                    client.send(message).await
                })(item.client.clone(), message.clone()),
            );
        }

        // just want to join all here
        while let Some(_) = js.join_next().await {}
    }
```


Based on the provided Rust code, it seems you have an asynchronous function `ping_all` that sends a ping message to all `RemotePlayer` instances stored in some collection `self.inner`. The message includes the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch, or `1` if the current time can't be obtained for some reason. The Rust `JoinSet` is used for managing concurrently running tasks.

The conversion to Go will involve a few steps:
1. Go does not have a direct equivalent to Rust's `JoinSet`, but we can achieve a similar effect using a `WaitGroup`.
2. We won't use an exact replacement for `RemoteMessage::Ping` but will simulate it with a struct.
3. The error handling and time manipulation are straightforward to adapt.

Here is a Go version of the Rust code:

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"
    "errors"
    "fmt"
)

// Assuming RemotePlayer and RemoteMessage are defined somewhere
type RemotePlayer interface {
    Send(message RemoteMessage)
}

type RemoteMessage struct {
    Ping int64
}

// Assuming inner is a struct that holds a map with clients. Let's simulate it:
type yourStruct struct {
    inner map[string]RemotePlayer
}

// NewYourStruct creates a yourStruct instance.
func NewYourStruct() *yourStruct {
    return &yourStruct{
        inner: make(map[string]RemotePlayer), // Assuming string keys for simplicity
    }
}

// PingAll sends a ping message to all RemotePlayers in inner.
func (s *yourStruct) PingAll() {
    // Getting the current time in seconds since the UNIX epoch, or 1 on error.
    pingMsg, err := timeSinceEpoch()
    if err != nil {
        pingMsg = 1
    }

    message := RemoteMessage{Ping: pingMsg}

    // WaitGroup is used to wait for all goroutines to finish.
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for _, client := range s.inner {
        wg.Add(1) // Increment the WaitGroup counter.
        go func(client RemotePlayer, message RemoteMessage) {
            defer wg.Done() // Decrement the counter when the goroutine completes.
            client.Send(message) // Assume each client has a Send method to receive the message.
        }(client, message)
    }

    wg.Wait() // Wait for all goroutines to complete.
}

// timeSinceEpoch returns the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch.
func timeSinceEpoch() (int64, error) {
    now := time.Now()
    unixTime := now.Unix()
    if unixTime < 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("invalid time")
    }
    return unixTime, nil
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    ys := NewYourStruct()
    // Assume RemotePlayer instances have been added to ys.inner here
    ys.PingAll()
    fmt.Println("All clients have been pinged.")
}
```

- `RemotePlayer` and `RemoteMessage` are interfaces and structs. You may need to adapt these types based on your actual implementation details.
- The `PingAll` method sends a `RemoteMessage` with the current UNIX timestamp to each `RemotePlayer` in `yourStruct.inner`.
- I've used Go's standard library `sync.WaitGroup` to ensure all goroutines have finished before `PingAll` returns.
- The error handling around the time calculation is similar, returning a fixed value `1` if there's an error getting the current time.

Make sure to adapt types and logic to fit your application's specific architecture and requirements.
