remove

```rust
    pub async fn remove(&mut self, key: SocketAddr) {
        let mut clear_default = false;

        if let Some(client) = self.inner.remove(&key) {
            if client.role == ClientRole::Player {
                // TODO: should check if no more players in Map, or even
                clear_default = self.inner.is_empty();
            }

            if let Err(e) = client.client.send(RemoteMessage::Close(key)).await {
                tracing::info!("error sending close to {}: {}", key, e);
            }
        }

        if clear_default || self.default_player_key == Some(key) {
            self.default_player = None;
            self.default_player_key = None;
        }
    }
```


Below is the equivalent code in Go, transformed from your Rust source. This code represents a method to remove an element from a collection, marked by a key of type `SocketAddr`. The equivalent for `SocketAddr` in Go will depend on your specific implementation, but often it's represented by `net.Addr` or a specific struct you have for clients. Since Go doesn't have built-in async support like Rust, I'll utilize Go's goroutine and channel features to achieve asynchronous behavior. Furthermore, Go doesn't have an exact counterpart for `Option`, so nil checks are used instead.

Note that I've tried to replicate the functionality as closely as possible, including error handling and the asynchronous message sending pattern using channels or Go's concurrency primitives because direct `.await` calls don't exist in Go.

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net"
    "sync"
)

// Assuming RemoteMessage and ClientRole are defined somewhere in your package.
// Similarly, assuming there's an implementation for sending RemoteMessage to a client.

type Client struct {
    // Assuming this is similar to your Rust client structure.
    Role   ClientRole
    Client *SomeClientType // SomeClientType should represent the client connection in your Go implementation.
}

// Example placeholder for ClientRole, define according to your actual implementation.
type ClientRole int

const (
    Player ClientRole = iota
    // Other roles as necessary.
)

// Since Go does not have enums like Rust, using constants or `iota` for ClientRole.

type SomeClientType struct {
    // Your implementation for the client, including the Send method for RemoteMessage.
}

func (c *SomeClientType) Send(msg RemoteMessage) error {
    // Implementation of how a message is sent to the client.
    return nil
}

type RemoteMessage string // Placeholder type, adjust to your needs.

type YourStruct struct {
    inner              map[net.Addr]*Client
    defaultPlayer      *Client
    defaultPlayerKey   *net.Addr
    lock               sync.Mutex // Protects access to the struct's fields
}

func (s *YourStruct) Remove(key net.Addr) {
    s.lock.Lock()
    defer s.lock.Unlock()

    var clearDefault bool

    if client, exists := s.inner[key]; exists {
        // Removing client by key
        delete(s.inner, key)

        if client.Role == Player {
            clearDefault = len(s.inner) == 0
        }

        go func() {
            // Asynchronously sending a close message to the removed client.
            if err := client.Client.Send(RemoteMessage("Close")); err != nil {
                log.Printf("error sending close to %v: %v", key, err)
            }
        }()
    }

    // Resetting default player if necessary.
    if clearDefault || (s.defaultPlayerKey != nil && *s.defaultPlayerKey == key) {
        s.defaultPlayer = nil
        s.defaultPlayerKey = nil
    }
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    s := YourStruct{
        inner: make(map[net.Addr]*Client),
        // Initialize other necessary fields.
    }

    // Assuming `key` is obtained or defined earlier.
    var key net.Addr // Placeholder for compilation. Define as needed.

    s.Remove(key)
}
```

This Go code snippet focuses on concurrency and error handling in Go's idiomatic way, using locks for thread safety and goroutines for asynchronous operations. It carefully respects the original Rust functionalities, including mutability and error logging, within the constraints and paradigms of Go.
