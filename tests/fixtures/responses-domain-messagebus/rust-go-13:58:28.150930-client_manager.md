Client

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Client {
    client: Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>,
    role: ClientRole,
    timestamp: SystemTime,
    last_message: Option<RemoteMessage>,
}
```


To convert the provided Rust source code to Go (Golang), we need to consider several differences between Rust and Go, including their approaches to memory safety, concurrency, and object-oriented features. Go does not have a direct counterpart to Rust's `Arc` for atomic reference counting, but we can use Go's built-in concurrency features like channels or mutexes for managing shared resources if needed. Additionally, Go does not offer built-in "deriving" traits like Clone; instead, we must implement any needed behavior explicitly.

Given these differences, I'll translate your Rust struct and associated features into idiomatic Go code. The translation will include a struct definition, considering Go's way of handling memory safety and concurrency without direct analogs for Rust's Arc or the derive macro.

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// RemotePlayer is an interface that must be defined in Go, mirroring the functionalities
// of its Rust counterpart. This interface will represent the behavior that a RemotePlayer
// must implement.
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // Define methods that the RemotePlayer needs to have. For example:
    Play() error
    Pause() error
    // Add other necessary method signatures based on the actual Rust interface
}

// ClientRole must be defined in Go, potentially as an enum. Given no information
// was provided about its specifics, an example placeholder type is provided.
type ClientRole int

const (
    // Example roles, assuming these might exist. Adjust according to the actual roles defined in Rust.
    RolePlayer ClientRole = iota
    RoleAdmin
    // Add other roles as needed
)

// RemoteMessage mirrors the RemoteMessage struct from Rust. Without specifics,
// this acts as a placeholder requiring further definition.
type RemoteMessage struct {
    // Define the struct fields based on the actual Rust struct.
}

// Client represents a client connected to a server (or similar)
// handling remote players. It is the Go equivalent of the provided Rust struct.
type Client struct {
    client      RemotePlayer
    role        ClientRole
    timestamp   time.Time
    lastMessage *RemoteMessage // Using a pointer to capture the Option in Rust, nil will signify None.

    // mutex will help us manage concurrent access to lastMessage safely,
    // as Go does not provide built-in thread safety like Rust's Arc.
    mutex sync.RWMutex
}

// NewClient is a constructor function for creating a new Client instance with safe defaults.
func NewClient(client RemotePlayer, role ClientRole) *Client {
    return &Client{
        client:    client,
        role:      role,
        timestamp: time.Now(), // Assuming SystemTime's equivalent is the current time
        // lastMessage is implicitly nil (None)
    }
}

// LastMessage returns the last message received by the client.
// It safely handles concurrent access using a read lock.
func (c *Client) LastMessage() *RemoteMessage {
    c.mutex.RLock()
    defer c.mutex.RUnlock()

    return c.lastMessage
}

// SetLastMessage safely updates the client's last message, employing a write lock.
func (c *Client) SetLastMessage(message *RemoteMessage) {
    c.mutex.Lock()
    defer c.mutex.Unlock()

    c.lastMessage = message
}

// Example of how you might use interface methods; you'll need to add definitions for these based on your specifics.
func (c *Client) UseClient() {
    // Example: safely call a method on the RemotePlayer
    // Error handling is omitted for simplicity
    _ = c.client.Play()
    // Assume there are other operations you would do...
}

func main() {
    // This is where your main application logic would go.
    // You would typically create client instances, interact with them, etc.
}
```
This Go code snippet creates a foundation based on the provided Rust struct, incorporating Go's idiomatic approaches to memory safety, interface usage, and error handling. Given the information provided, some assumptions were made about the functionalities of `RemotePlayer`, `ClientRole`, and `RemoteMessage`. These will need to be adapted to fit the actual requirements and specific implementations in your Rust codebase.
