new_remote_control

```rust
    pub fn new_remote_control(client: &Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) -> Self {
        Self {
            client: client.clone(),
            role: ClientRole::RemoteControl,
            timestamp: SystemTime::now(),
            last_message: None,
        }
    }
```


To convert your Rust snippet to Go, we'll need to adapt a few things due to differences between the languages, particularly around error handling, pointer semantics, and the way interfaces are used. Note that in Go, there's no direct equivalent of Rust's `Arc` as Go's garbage collector handles shared references. We'll simulate a similar scenario using interfaces and pointers where applicable.

Rust's `SystemTime` will be replaced with Go's `time.Time` from the `time` package. For simplicity, I'll assume that `RemotePlayer` can be represented as an interface in Go and that `ClientRole` is an enumerated type (enum) which we'd typically handle with constant values in Go.

I'll add comments to explain each part of the Go code.

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// Assuming RemotePlayer is defined somewhere as:
// type RemotePlayer interface {
//     SomeMethod() // As an example, adapt as necessary.
// }

// Assuming ClientRole is defined with iota for enum-like behavior:
// const (
//     RemoteControl ClientRole = iota
//     AnotherRole
//     // Add other roles as necessary
// )

// ClientRole replaces the enum from Rust.
type ClientRole int

// RemoteControl is a struct that approximates the original Rust struct.
// Note how we store a pointer to the interface, this is akin to using Arc<dyn RemotePlayer> in Rust but managed by Go's GC.
type RemoteControl struct {
	client      *RemotePlayer
	role        ClientRole
	timestamp   time.Time
	lastMessage *string // Assuming last message can be nil, hence a pointer. Adapt as applicable.
}

// NewRemoteControl function simulates the Rust constructor.
// It takes a client of type RemotePlayer (interface) and returns a new instance of RemoteControl.
func NewRemoteControl(client RemotePlayer) *RemoteControl {
	// In Go, interfaces are implicitly pointers when they point to a struct,
	// so there's no need for explicit cloning as in Rust's Arc::clone.
	// However, we're taking the address of client to explicitly show the pointer being stored.
	return &RemoteControl{
		client:      &client, // Store the reference to the RemotePlayer instance.
		role:        RemoteControl, // Assuming RemoteControl is a predefined constant for ClientRole.
		timestamp:   time.Now(), // Captures the current system time.
		lastMessage: nil, // Initializes the lastMessage as nil, indicating no message.
	}
}

// This is a minimal setup. In real-world usage, you would also need to define the RemotePlayer interface
// and the related methods, enums (for ClientRole), and possibly synchronization mechanisms if shared state updates are involved.
// The time package is used for timestamp capturing, similar to SystemTime in Rust.
```

Some assumptions were made regarding `RemotePlayer` and `ClientRole` as these were not fully described in your snippet. This Go code provides a base structure for converting the Rust code, maintaining major concepts, albeit adapted to fit Go language idioms and conventions.
