send

```rust
        async fn send(&self, message: RemoteMessage) -> Result<StatusCode, String> {
            self.sender.send(message).await.map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
            Ok(StatusCode::OK)
        }
```


To convert the given Rust async function to an equivalent in Golang, there are a few important differences to note between Rust and Go:

1. Error handling in Go is not done through returning `Result<T, E>`, but rather by returning an error as a second return value.
2. Golang does not have built-in async/await syntax like Rust but uses goroutines and channels to achieve concurrency.
3. The function signature and the way methods are defined for structures are different in Go. 

Below is how you might rewrite the provided Rust code in Golang, making use of channels or the `context` package for managing cancellation. I'll assume that we're dealing with a similar setup where `send` is a method of a struct that contains a sender of type `chan RemoteMessage` (as channels are a common way to handle asynchronous operations in Go). This is a simplification and depending on your use case, you might need to adjust accordingly (e.g., using more sophisticated message passing or synchronization techniques).

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

// Assuming RemoteMessage is a previously defined struct that you want to send
type RemoteMessage struct {
    // Message details here
}

// Assuming Sender is a struct that has a channel for sending RemoteMessages
// and possibly other fields relevant to sending messages
type Sender struct {
    senderChan chan RemoteMessage
}

// NewSender initializes a new Sender with a channel for RemoteMessages
func NewSender() *Sender {
    return &Sender{
        senderChan: make(chan RemoteMessage),
    }
}

// Send tries to send a RemoteMessage, returns HTTP status code on success or error on failure
// Note: Context is passed for managing cancellation
func (s *Sender) Send(ctx context.Context, message RemoteMessage) (int, error) {
    // A select statement is used here to send message on the senderChan but also respect cancellation
    select {
    case s.senderChan <- message:
        // If successfully sent the message, return HTTP 200 status
        return http.StatusOK, nil
    case <-ctx.Done():
        // If the context is cancelled, return an error
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("sending cancelled")
    }
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    sender := NewSender()
    message := RemoteMessage{} // Initialize your message here
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel() // Good practice to ensure resources are freed

    status, err := sender.Send(ctx, message)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("Message sent successfully with status: %d\n", status)
    }
}
```

This Go code provides a way to asynchronously send messages, with context-based cancellation. The `Send` method attempts to send a `RemoteMessage` through a channel, and returns an appropriate status code if successful, or an error if not. The use of `context.Context` allows calling code to manage timeouts or cancellations.
