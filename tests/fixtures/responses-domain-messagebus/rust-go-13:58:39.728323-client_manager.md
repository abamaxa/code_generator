new_player

```rust
    pub fn new_player(client: &Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) -> Self {
        Self {
            client: client.clone(),
            role: ClientRole::Player,
            timestamp: SystemTime::now(),
            last_message: None,
        }
    }
```


To convert the provided Rust function to Go, we first need to understand what the Rust code does. This Rust function, `new_player`, is a constructor for a struct (could be named something like `Player` or similar, based on its usage of `Self`). It takes a reference to a `RemotePlayer` (which is dynamically dispatched, noted by `dyn`), wraps it with an atomic reference counted pointer (`Arc`), and initializes a structure with this client, a role (presumably set to some predefined value of `ClientRole::Player`), the current system time, and an empty option for `last_message`.

In Go, we don't have direct equivalents for a few Rust concepts like `Arc` (for atomic reference counting) and `dyn` (for dynamic dispatch), but we can accomplish something similar using interfaces and pointer types. Here is how you can translate it to Go, assuming some liberties for types that need to be translated or created from scratch based on the Rust context you've provided:

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// Assuming RemotePlayer is an interface that your `client` parameter should satisfy.
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // methods here that your RemotePlayer needs to satisfy
}

// Assuming ClientRole is an enum or constant in Rust, we'll use iotas in Go.
type ClientRole int

const (
    Player ClientRole = iota // assigning Player to be the first value
    // Other roles here
)

// Assuming your struct is something like this based on what `Self` refers to in Rust.
type Player struct {
    client      RemotePlayer
    role        ClientRole
    timestamp   time.Time
    lastMessage *string // using a pointer to string to be able to represent a "None" value with nil
    mu          sync.Mutex // Since there's no direct equivalent to Arc in Go, using mutex for protecting shared access, if necessary.
}

// NewPlayer creates a new Player instance with the provided remote client, initializes the player's state.
func NewPlayer(client RemotePlayer) *Player {
    // Directly assigning values as Go doesn't have constructors in the same sense Rust does.
    return &Player{
        client:      client,
        role:        Player, // Assuming this is a predefined role, based on the Rust version.
        timestamp:   time.Now(),
        lastMessage: nil, // nil signifies the Rust equivalent of None
        // Mutex does not need to be explicitly initialized.
    }
}
```

Some notes on the translation:
- I've introduced a `sync.Mutex` in the Go struct, `Player`, to hint at thread safety if the `RemotePlayer` is shared across goroutines. In Rust, `Arc` makes shared ownership thread-safe, but Go handles concurrency differently, often using channels or mutexes.
- Go's `interface` is used similarly to Rust's trait for `RemotePlayer`. However, the dynamic dispatch mechanism is implicit in Go when interfaces are involved.
- I've translated the `SystemTime::now()` to `time.Now()` in Go to get the current time.
- For `last_message`, Go doesn't have an `Option` type, so a pointer is used to achieve optional semantics (`nil` can represent `None`).

Remember, this translation assumes some liberties with the type and structure definitions that were not provided in your Rust snippet. You might need to adjust the Go code according to your actual definitions of `RemotePlayer`, the context where `ClientRole` is defined, and how you're handling concurrency.
