add_player

```rust
    pub fn add_player(&mut self, key: SocketAddr, client: Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>) {
        self.inner.insert(key, Client::new_player(&client));
        self.default_player = Some(client);
        self.default_player_key = Some(key);
    }
```


To accurately convert this Rust code snippet to Go (Golang), we need to make some assumptions about the types and structures involved since the original Rust code references a few concepts (`SocketAddr`, `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>`, `self.inner` and `Client::new_player`) that are specific to Rust or the context of the Rust codebase. 

In Golang, there isn't a direct equivalent to Rust's `Arc<dyn SomeTrait>` for shared ownership and dynamic dispatch. The closest approximation would be using interfaces and possibly pointer types for shared references. Go's map and its handling of concurrency (if needed) will also differ from Rust's approach.

Here's an attempt to convert the provided Rust function into a Go method, making some assumptions for the conversion:

1. Assuming there's a struct associated with the method we're translating, let's call it `GameManager`.
2. We're assuming `Client::new_player` is a function that takes a reference to something that satisfies a `RemotePlayer` interface and returns a `Client` instance.
3. `SocketAddr` in Rust is a representation of a socket address. In Go, the `net` package provides `Addr` interface and specific types such as `TCPAddr` or `UDPAddr` that could serve as equivalents, but for simplicity, we'll use `string` assuming it contains an IP address and port.
4. Go does not have "default" visibility like Rust's `pub` keyword. All Go identifiers that start with an upper-case letter are exported (visible outside its package), and those that start with a lower-case letter are package-private.

Given these assumptions, a converted Go code snippet might look something like this:

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
)

// Assuming RemotePlayer is an interface that client struct must satisfy.
type RemotePlayer interface {
    // Interface methods
}

// Client - Assuming we have a Client struct similar to the Rust version
type Client struct {
    // Fields
}

// NewPlayer - Assuming this is akin to Rust's Client::new_player function.
// It takes something that satisfies the RemotePlayer interface and returns a Client instance.
func NewPlayer(player RemotePlayer) *Client {
    // Implementation
    return &Client{}
}

// GameManager - struct to hold our players and related data.
type GameManager struct {
    inner            map[string]*Client // Using string as a stand-in for SocketAddr for simplicity
    defaultPlayer    RemotePlayer
    defaultPlayerKey string
    mutex            sync.Mutex // Adding Mutex for thread-safe access to the map, if needed
}

// AddPlayer - Adds a new player to the GameManager.
func (gm *GameManager) AddPlayer(key string, client RemotePlayer) {
    gm.mutex.Lock()
    defer gm.mutex.Unlock()

    // Converting a RemotePlayer to a Client and inserting it into map.
    // Assuming the key is a string representation of SocketAddr for simplicity.
    gm.inner[key] = NewPlayer(client)

    // Setting the default player and its key
    gm.defaultPlayer = client
    gm.defaultPlayerKey = key
}
```

Please note that in Go, error handling, interface methods, and the specific implementation details for `NewPlayer` would need to be fleshed out based on the actual application logic and requirements. Also, the usage of a mutex in the Go version points toward handling concurrent access to the `inner` map, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the Rust snippet but is a common concern in Go applications, especially web servers or similar.
