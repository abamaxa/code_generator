test_remove_player

```rust
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_remove_player() {
        let message_exchange = MessageExchange::new();
        let addr = SocketAddr::new(IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1)), 8080);
        let remote_player = MockRemotePlayer::new(addr);

        message_exchange
            .add_player(addr, remote_player.clone())
            .await;
        message_exchange.remove(addr).await;

        let players = message_exchange.list_players().await;
        assert_eq!(players.len(), 0);
    }
```


To convert the provided Rust async test code into Go (Golang), I'll assume some equivalent setup, as the provided Rust code relies on certain data structures and methods (`MessageExchange`, `MockRemotePlayer`, etc.) which don't have direct equivalents in Go. I'll create a simulated scenario in Go which has similar functionalities. Note that Go uses a different approach for asynchronous programming, typically leveraging goroutines and channels instead of `async`/`await`.

First, ensure you've got Go set up properly on your system and familiarize yourself with Go's testing package and goroutine model if you haven't already. The Go test file should be named with a `_test.go` suffix and be in the same package as the code it's testing.

```go
package yourpackage // replace with your actual package name

import (
    "net"
    "testing"
    "time"

    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert" // This package is great for more expressive assertions
)

// Assuming MessageExchange, MockRemotePlayer and similar required types/functions are defined elsewhere in your code.

// TestRemovePlayer demonstrates removing a player and verifying the operation
func TestRemovePlayer(t *testing.T) {
    // Using channels to simulate asynchronous behavior and wait for operations to complete
    doneCh := make(chan bool)

    go func() {
        me := NewMessageExchange() // Assuming this initializes your MessageExchange equivalent
        addr := "127.0.0.1:8080" // Mock address, same as in the Rust example

        // Initialize your mock player, assuming a somewhat similar setup
        mockPlayer := NewMockRemotePlayer(addr)

        // Add the player (adjust method names as appropriate for your Go implementation)
        err := me.AddPlayer(addr, mockPlayer)
        if err != nil {
            t.Errorf("Failed to add player: %v", err)
            doneCh <- true
            return
        }

        // Remove the player
        err = me.RemovePlayer(addr)
        if err != nil {
            t.Errorf("Failed to remove player: %v", err)
            doneCh <- true
            return
        }

        // List the players to check the count, assuming this returns a slice of some player type
        players, err := me.ListPlayers()
        if err != nil {
            t.Errorf("Failed to list players: %v", err)
            doneCh <- true
            return
        }

        // Assert that the players slice is empty using testify's assert package
        assert.Equal(t, 0, len(players), "There should be no players left")

        doneCh <- true
    }()

    select {
    case <-doneCh:
        // Test completed, exit the goroutine
    case <-time.After(5 * time.Second): // Adjust timeout as needed for your specific test conditions
        t.Fatal("Test timed out")
    }
}

// Mock or implementations of NewMessageExchange, NewMockRemotePlayer, etc., should go here or in their respective files.
```

This Golang test example leverages goroutines and channels to simulate asynchronous behavior and uses the `assert` package from testify for an assertion, which makes the test more readable and expressive. However, it's important to remember that synchronization mechanisms like channels or wait groups are crucial when dealing with concurrent operations in tests to ensure that your tests only complete after all asynchronous operations have finished.

Additionally, error handling is more explicit in Go. You'll often check if an operation returned an error immediately after performing it, which is slightly different from the error propagation model you might be used to in Rust.

Remember, the exact implementation details will depend on how you've designed your `MessageExchange`, `MockRemotePlayer`, and related functions/types in Go. This example assumes similar functionality but in a Go idiomatic way.
