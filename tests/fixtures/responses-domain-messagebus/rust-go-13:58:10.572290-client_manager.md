send_last_message

```rust
    pub async fn send_last_message(&self, to_host: SocketAddr) {
        if let Some(destination) = self.inner.get(&to_host) {
            for item in self.inner.values() {
                if item.role != ClientRole::Player {
                    continue;
                }
                if let Some(message) = &item.last_message {
                    if let Err(err) = destination.client.send(message.clone()).await {
                        tracing::error!("could not send last message {}, {}", to_host, err);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```


To translate the provided Rust function to Go, we need to make some assumptions since Go and Rust have significant syntactic and paradigm differences:

1. The general structure of the application and types like `ClientRole`, `SocketAddr`, or how messages are sent and received in Go as compared to Rust's async pattern with Tokio or similar.

2. How logging (equivalent to `tracing::error!` in Rust) is handled in the Go version.

3. The error handling mechanism in Go, which is different from Rustâ€™s pattern matching with `if let`.

With these points in mind, a direct conversion may look something like this in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "sync"
    // Assuming a custom package "client" exists that defines your client logic
    "yourproject/client" 
)

// Assuming Client and ClientRole are defined in your "client" package.

type Server struct {
    inner map[net.Addr]*client.Client // Assuming each client is keyed by its `net.Addr` and contains last_message among other things.
    mu    sync.RWMutex                // Go maps are not safe for concurrent use, so we protect it with a mutex
}

func (s *Server) SendLastMessage(toHost net.Addr) {
    s.mu.RLock() // Read lock
    defer s.mu.RUnlock()

    destination, ok := s.inner[toHost]
    if !ok {
        return
    }
    
    for _, item := range s.inner {
        if item.Role != client.Player {
            continue
        }
        message := item.LastMessage
        if message != nil {
            if err := destination.Client.Send(*message); err != nil {
                // Assumes a global logger is defined elsewhere, or use fmt for simplicity here.
                fmt.Printf("could not send last message %v, %v\n", toHost, err)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code does the following in Go:
- Maps a server's connected clients in a thread-safe way using a mutex.
- Iterates through each client, finding players with a last message.
- Attempts to resend this last message to a specific destination client.
- Logs an error if the message fails to send.

Keep in mind, however, that Go does not have built-in async functionality like Rust, so if `destination.Client.Send` is a blocking call that you wish to run asynchronously, you may need to execute it in a goroutine and manage its synchronization context appropriately. Also, the error handling and logging are simplified and should be adapted to fit your application's specific logging and error handling strategy.

Without fully understanding the structures and patterns used in your Rust project (like what `client.send` does exactly or how `ClientRole` and `SocketAddr` are defined and used), this is a generalized conversion. You'll need to adjust the details to fit your actual Go project structure and libraries.
