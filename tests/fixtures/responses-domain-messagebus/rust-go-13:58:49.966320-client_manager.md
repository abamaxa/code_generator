get

```rust
    pub fn get(&self, key: SocketAddr) -> Option<Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>> {
        if let Some(entry) = self.inner.get(&key) {
            return Some(entry.client.clone());
        }

        self.default_player.clone()
    }
```


Below is the provided Rust code translated into Go (Golang). This function is a part of a struct (in Rust, which would be somewhat equivalent to a method of a struct in Go). Given that Go doesn't have the exact same constructs as Rust, especially around polymorphism and concurrency safety (Arc in Rust), there are some differences in the approach.

In Rust, `Arc` is often used to share data across threads safely. In Go, this pattern is less commonly needed due to Go's concurrent programming model revolving around channels and goroutines. For an equivalent, we might use pointers or interfaces directly, considering Go's garbage collection and interface-based type system for polymorphism.

The Rust code appears to be a part of a method that retrieves a `RemotePlayer` based on a `key` (of type `SocketAddr`), with `Option<Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>>` being the return type, indicating it may or may not return an object implementing the `RemotePlayer` trait.

In Go, since there isn't a direct equivalent of Rust's `Option` type, we'd typically use a pointer that can be `nil`. Also, for dynamically dispatched interfaces (`dyn RemotePlayer` in Rust), Go just uses interfaces directly.

Given these differences, here's a hypothetical Go translation:

```go
package mypackage

import (
	"net"
	"sync"
)

// RemotePlayer is an interface that must be implemented
// by any type that wants to be considered a RemotePlayer.
type RemotePlayer interface {
	// Define methods that a RemotePlayer should have
}

// MyStruct represents the struct context of the original Rust code.
type MyStruct struct {
	// Assuming inner is a map holding clients against SocketAddr keys.
	// In Go, the concurrent map access must be managed explicitly with sync.RWMutex.
	inner map[net.Addr]*RemotePlayer
	lock  sync.RWMutex
	
	defaultPlayer *RemotePlayer
}

// Get retrieves a RemotePlayer based on a given key (of type net.Addr, similar to SocketAddr in Rust).
// It returns a pointer to a RemotePlayer or nil if not found.
func (ms *MyStruct) Get(key net.Addr) *RemotePlayer {
	ms.lock.RLock() // ensure safe concurrent read access
	defer ms.lock.RUnlock()

	if entry, ok := ms.inner[key]; ok {
		// Found the entry, return a clone (assuming clone logic or simply returning the pointer)
		return entry
	}

	// Return defaultPlayer, assuming it's a pointer and can be nil.
	// Note: Go supports returning nil directly for interface pointers.
	return ms.defaultPlayer
}
```

A few notes:
- In Rust, `Arc<dyn RemotePlayer>` suggests both thread-safe reference counting and dynamic dispatch, for which Go uses interfaces directly. Go doesn't need `Arc` due to its garbage collection.
- Go utilizes a mutex (`sync.RWMutex`) to safely access the map (`inner`) concurrently. This is because Go does not automatically ensure thread-safe access to shared resources like Rust's type system does.
- The function signature in Go is simpler since Go's nilable interface pointers can carry the meaning of "no value" similar to Rust's `Option`. 

This translation assumes knowledge about the original Rust struct's fields and purposes, translating them into Go idioms where direct equivalents are not available. Adjustments might be necessary based on the broader context of your application and specific interface method definitions for `RemotePlayer`.
