new

```rust
    fn new(value: broadcast::Receiver<T>) -> Self {
        Self { receiver: value }
    }
```


To convert the Rust snippet you provided into Go, we need to make a few assumptions since the code snippet is a bit out of context. Assuming `Self` represents a struct that is wrapping a `Receiver` in Rust, which comes from a broadcasting mechanism probably provided by a library like `tokio::sync::broadcast`, we would replicate a similar behavior in Go using channels. Go's native channel support can act similarly to Rust's broadcast channels, albeit with some differences in behavior and usage.

Given these assumptions, here's how the conversion might look, including comments to describe the code:

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
)

// Assuming T is some predefined type. In Go, we have to use interface{} to represent a generic type in this context.
// This means we lose some type safety unless we explicitly check types where necessary.

// Broadcaster wraps a Go channel to implement broadcast-like behavior.
// Note: Go's native channels do not support broadcast in the same way as Rust's broadcast channels, 
// so we implement a simple broadcaster using channels and a slice of channels for subscribers.
type Broadcaster[T any] struct {
	receiver chan T        // The main channel to receive messages.
	subs     []chan T      // Slice of subscriber channels.
	mu       sync.Mutex    // Mutex to protect subscribers slice.
}

// New creates a new Broadcaster.
// It initializes the receiver channel and subscriber list.
func New[T any](value chan T) *Broadcaster[T] {
	return &Broadcaster[T]{
		receiver: value,
		subs:     make([]chan T, 0),
	}
}

// Please note:
// 1. This is a simplified version and might not exactly match the behavior of a broadcast receiver in Rust.
//    Specifically, Go does not have a built-in way to do broadcasting to multiple receivers out of the box with a single channel.
// 2. The actual broadcasting to subscribers (not shown) would require additional methods to manage subscriptions and to broadcast messages to all subscribers.
//    These operations must ensure thread-safety, hence the use of a mutex.
// 3. I used a go generic [T any] to somewhat simulate Rust generics. This feature requires Go 1.18 or newer.
```

This Go version attempts to capture the essence of a broadcast receiver with respect to the original Rust context, but due to differences between Go and Rust, particularly around channel and concurrency primitives, it's not a direct one-to-one mapping. The Go version uses channels and slices to simulate broadcasting to multiple receivers, and integrates thread safety via mutexes. Note that in a real-world application, you'd likely need additional functions to manage broadcasting, subscriptions, and ensure safe concurrent access.
