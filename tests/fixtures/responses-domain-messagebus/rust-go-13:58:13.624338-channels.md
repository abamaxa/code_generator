MessageReceiver < T >

```rust
impl<T> MessageReceiver<T> {
    fn new(value: broadcast::Receiver<T>) -> Self {
        Self { receiver: value }
    }
}
```


To convert the given Rust snippet into Go (Golang), we need to take into account the differences in how both languages handle concurrency and struct definition. Rust's `broadcast::Receiver` is part of its asynchronous communication mechanism, often used with `tokio` for handling concurrent programming tasks. Go, on the other hand, utilizes goroutines and channels for concurrency.

Given that Go does not have generics until version 1.18 (and even then, it's usage is a bit different from Rust's), the conversion will focus on a specific type for simplicity unless you're using Go 1.18 or later. For this example, let's assume we are dealing with messages of type `int`. If you need to handle different types, you'll have to define multiple functions or use Go 1.18's type parameters.

### Go Version (For Go 1.17 and below, assuming `int` type)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// MessageReceiver holds a channel to receive messages.
type MessageReceiver struct {
	receiver chan int
}

// NewMessageReceiver creates a new MessageReceiver with the provided channel.
func NewMessageReceiver(value chan int) *MessageReceiver {
	return &MessageReceiver{receiver: value}
}

// Example usage
func main() {
	// Create a channel for ints
	ch := make(chan int)

	// Create a new MessageReceiver with the channel
	receiver := NewMessageReceiver(ch)

	// Example use of the receiver (would usually happen in a different goroutine)
	go func() {
		// Send a message into the channel
		ch <- 42
	}()

	// Receive the message (blocking call)
	message := <-receiver.receiver
	fmt.Printf("Received message: %d\n", message)
}
```

### Go Version (Using Generics, Go 1.18+)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// MessageReceiver is a generic struct for receiving messages of any type.
// T is the type of the message.
type MessageReceiver[T any] struct {
	receiver chan T
}

// NewMessageReceiver creates a new instance of MessageReceiver.
func NewMessageReceiver[T any](value chan T) *MessageReceiver[T] {
	return &MessageReceiver[T]{receiver: value}
}

// Example usage
func main() {
	// Create a channel for int messages
	ch := make(chan int)

	// Create a new MessageReceiver
	receiver := NewMessageReceiver(ch)

	// Example use of the receiver (would usually happen in a different goroutine)
	go func() {
		// Send a message into the channel
		ch <- 42
	}()

	// Receive the message (blocking call)
	message := <-receiver.receiver
	fmt.Printf("Received message: %d\n", message)
}
```

This code demonstrates defining a generic struct `MessageReceiver` in Go, capable of handling messages of any type via channels, similar to Rust's approach but adapted to the Go programming paradigm. Note that for Go versions before 1.18, you'll need to define specific types or use interface{} and perform type assertions, which isn't as type-safe or idiomatic as using generics in Go 1.18+.
