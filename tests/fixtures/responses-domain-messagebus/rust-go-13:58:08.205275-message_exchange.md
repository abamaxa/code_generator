get_sender

```rust
    pub fn get_sender(&self) -> mpsc::Sender<ReceivedRemoteMessage> {
        self.sender.clone()
    }
```


To rewrite the provided Rust function into Go, we need to keep in mind several key differences between the two languages:

1. Rust uses `mpsc` (multi-producer, single-consumer) for message passing, while Go has channels as a native feature for concurrency.
2. Rust methods are defined with `&self` for borrowing the instance, whereas Go uses receivers in method definitions.
3. Rust's `clone` method for duplicating objects, including sender objects, doesn't have a direct equivalent in Go for channels since channels are reference types and copying them doesn't require a method call.

Given these points, we'll convert the functionality to Go, focusing on creating a method that returns a channel of a custom type, similar to the `Sender<ReceivedRemoteMessage>` in Rust. Since detailed implementation of `ReceivedRemoteMessage` isn't provided, this example assumes it's a struct type.

Here's the converted Go code:

```go
package main

import "sync"

// Assuming ReceivedRemoteMessage is already defined somewhere
type ReceivedRemoteMessage struct {
    // add fields here
}

// MyStruct would be the Go equivalent of the Rust struct this method is a part of.
// Assuming it has a sender field which is a channel of ReceivedRemoteMessage.
type MyStruct struct {
    sender chan ReceivedRemoteMessage
    mutex  sync.Mutex // Added to safely clone (copy) the sender channel reference
}

// GetSender method returns a copy of the sender channel.
// Go channels are reference types, so this effectively returns a reference to the same channel.
func (m *MyStruct) GetSender() chan ReceivedRemoteMessage {
    m.mutex.Lock()
    defer m.mutex.Unlock()
    // In Go, channels are reference types, so we can return the sender directly.
    // This is a simplistic approach; if the goal were to truly clone or duplicate the channel's behavior, 
    // more complex handling would be required, such as creating a new channel and transferring messages.
    return m.sender
}
```

Note that the `sync.Mutex` is used to make the copying of the channel reference thread-safe. This is more of a placeholder to indicate thread safety concerns; the actual necessity depends on your application's architecture. Channels in Go are inherently safe for concurrent use, being designed to communicate between goroutines. However, if your struct is accessed and modified concurrently, protecting its fields becomes necessary.

Remember, the direct translation of cloning a sender like in Rust isn't exactly one-to-one in Go due to conceptual differences in how channels and concurrency are handled between the two languages. This Go example assumes you're looking for a similar pattern of returning a reference to a communicative channel within a struct.
