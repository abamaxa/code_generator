dispatch_message

```rust
    async fn dispatch_message(
        client_map: ClientMap,
        player_key: SocketAddr,
        message: RemoteMessage,
    ) {
        let mut clients = vec![];
        {
            let mut map = client_map.write().await;

            clients.extend(map.get_clients(player_key));

            map.update_last_message(&player_key, message.clone());
        }

        if !clients.is_empty() {
            let mut result_set = JoinSet::new();
            for client in clients.into_iter() {
                let message = message.clone();
                result_set.spawn(async move {
                    match client.send(message).await {
                        Ok(result) => (result, Json(Response::success("success".to_string()))),
                        Err(e) => (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, Json(Response::error(e))),
                    }
                });
            }

            // just want to join all here
            while let Some(_) = result_set.join_next().await {}
        }
    }
```


To rewrite the provided Rust async function `dispatch_message` into Golang, we should focus on the main functionalities and their equivalents in Go. The Rust code involves asynchronous execution, mutex for thread-safe access to a shared data structure (`client_map`), and spawning of tasks. Go's concurrency model relies heavily on goroutines and channels, making it suitable for such a task.

Key considerations for the translation:

1. Go does not have a native equivalent of Rust's futures and `async`/`await`, but we can use goroutines and channels to achieve similar asynchronous behavior.
2. Go's `sync` package, especially `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex`, will be used for thread-safe access.
3. Error handling in Go is different; it prefers explicit error checking over Rust's `Result` and `Option` types.
4. Go doesn't have built-in equivalents to Rust's `JoinSet`, but we can manage a collection of goroutines and wait for their completion using a `sync.WaitGroup`.

Given that some contextual information about `ClientMap`, `RemoteMessage`, or how `client.send` is implemented is missing, the Go version will focus on the structural translation and logical flow. Notable Rust-specific features (like pattern matching) will be adapted to Go's idiomatic constructs.

Here's a simplified and commented version in Go, leveraging channels, goroutines, and `sync.WaitGroup` for concurrency:

```go
package main

import (
	"net"
	"sync"
)

// Assuming definitions of RemoteMessage and Response for completeness
type RemoteMessage struct {
	// Content or fields relevant to the message
}

type Response struct {
	// Simplified version; actual implementation may vary
	Success bool
	Message string
}

func NewSuccessResponse(message string) *Response {
    return &Response{Success: true, Message: message}
}

func NewErrorResponse(message string) *Response {
    return &Response{Success: false, Message: message}
}

// Client is a placeholder for a client connection.
// The actual implementation depends on how you manage client connections.
type Client struct {
    // Assuming there's a Send method with the following signature.
    Send(msg RemoteMessage) error
}

// ClientMap is a placeholder for thread-safe client map with relevant methods.
type ClientMap struct {
    sync.RWMutex
    // Other fields and methods to manage clients.
}

// GetClients and UpdateLastMessage methods should be implemented as part of ClientMap.

func dispatchMessage(clientMap *ClientMap, playerKey net.Addr, message RemoteMessage) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    clients := getAndPrepareClients(clientMap, playerKey, message)

    if len(clients) > 0 {
        responses := make(chan *Response, len(clients))

        for _, client := range clients {
            wg.Add(1)
            go func(c Client) {
                defer wg.Done()
                if err := c.Send(message); err != nil {
                    responses <- NewErrorResponse(err.Error())
                } else {
                    responses <- NewSuccessResponse("success")
                }
            }(client)
        }
        
        // Wait for all goroutines to finish
        wg.Wait()
        close(responses)

        // Process responses (e.g., log them) if needed
        // for response := range responses {
        //     // Handle response
        // }
    }
}

func getAndPrepareClients(clientMap *ClientMap, playerKey net.Addr, message RemoteMessage) []Client {
    clientMap.Lock()
    defer clientMap.Unlock()
    
    // Dummy implementation; actual implementation would fetch clients based on playerKey and update message
    // clients := clientMap.GetClients(playerKey)
    // clientMap.UpdateLastMessage(playerKey, message)

    return []Client{} // Assuming this returns relevant clients
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    clientMap := &ClientMap{}
    playerKey := &net.TCPAddr{} // Example key, use actual player key
    message := RemoteMessage{}  // Example message, populate as needed

    dispatchMessage(clientMap, playerKey, message)
}
```

This Go code snippet is simplified and focuses on the concurrency and logic structure of the original Rust function. Due to the lack of complete context (e.g., the precise nature of `ClientMap`, `RemoteMessage`, and client handling), you would need to adapt the `Client`, `ClientMap`, and message handling specifics according to your actual application's requirements.
