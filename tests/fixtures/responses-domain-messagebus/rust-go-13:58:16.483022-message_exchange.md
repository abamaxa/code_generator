get_receiver

```rust
    pub fn get_receiver(&self) -> broadcast::Receiver<ReceivedRemoteMessage> {
        self.receiver.subscribe()
    }
```


To convert the provided Rust function into Go, we need to understand what it does in Rust first. This function returns a `Receiver` from a `broadcast` channel. The `broadcast` channel type in Rust allows sending a value to all subscribed receivers. This pattern does not have a direct equivalent in the standard Go library, but a similar functionality can be achieved using Go's channels alongside additional code to manage broadcasting to multiple receivers.

Given Go does not have generics in the same way Rust does (until recently with the introduction of Go generics, which are still quite new and not as widely used or as feature-rich as Rust's), we'll assume the message type is a struct named `ReceivedRemoteMessage`. For simplicity, let's also assume it's a struct we can readily use. We'll simulate a broadcaster that can have multiple receivers/subscribers.

Here's how the equivalent functionality could be implemented in Go, including setting up a broadcaster type to manage multiple subscribers:

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
)

// ReceivedRemoteMessage represents the message structure.
type ReceivedRemoteMessage struct {
	// Define the fields of your message
}

// Broadcaster is used to broadcast messages to multiple receivers.
type Broadcaster struct {
	mu           sync.RWMutex       // Guards access to the 'subs' slice
	subs         []chan ReceivedRemoteMessage // Subscribed channels
}

// NewBroadcaster creates a new Broadcaster.
func NewBroadcaster() *Broadcaster {
	return &Broadcaster{}
}

// Subscribe adds a new subscriber to the Broadcaster and returns a channel to receive messages.
func (b *Broadcaster) Subscribe() <-chan ReceivedRemoteMessage {
	b.mu.Lock()
	defer b.mu.Unlock()

	ch := make(chan ReceivedRemoteMessage, 100) // Buffered channel
	b.subs = append(b.subs, ch)
	return ch
}

// Broadcast sends a message to all subscribed receivers.
func (b *Broadcaster) Broadcast(msg ReceivedRemoteMessage) {
	b.mu.RLock() // Use RLock to allow concurrent reads
	defer b.mu.RUnlock()

	for _, sub := range b.subs {
		// Non-blocking send, assuming subscribers are active and reading.
		select {
		case sub <- msg:
		default:
			// If a subscriber is not able to receive, skip.
		}
	}
}

// Assuming the existence of a broadcaster within a structure similar to the Rust example
type YourStruct struct {
	broadcaster *Broadcaster
}

// NewYourStruct initializes an instance of YourStruct with a broadcaster.
func NewYourStruct() *YourStruct {
	return &YourStruct{
		broadcaster: NewBroadcaster(),
	}
}

// GetReceiver returns a new subscriber channel to receive messages.
func (ys *YourStruct) GetReceiver() <-chan ReceivedRemoteMessage {
	return ys.broadcaster.Subscribe()
}

// The example shows how you might set up a broadcasting system similar to what the Rust code provided is doing.
// This involves managing subscriptions and broadcasting messages to all subscribers within the custom `Broadcaster` structure.
```

This Go code simulates the broadcasting functionality of the Rust `broadcast` channel. It provides a `Broadcaster` type to manage subscriptions and broadcast messages to all the subscribers. Note that Go's concurrency primitives require more manual management of these patterns compared to Rust's `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel.
