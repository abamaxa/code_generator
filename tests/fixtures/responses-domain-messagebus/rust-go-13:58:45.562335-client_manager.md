remove_old_entries

```rust
    pub async fn remove_old_entries(&mut self, older_than: SystemTime) {
        self.inner.retain(|_, client| client.timestamp > older_than);
    }
```


To rewrite the given Rust async function to Go, a direct apples-to-apples translation is tricky due to differences in language paradigms, especially around asynchronous execution and mutable state handling. Rust's `async` is fundamentally built into the language with a focus on futures and tasks, while Go uses goroutines and channels for concurrency. Additionally, Rust's borrowing rules ensure safe access to mutable state, a feature Go handles differently, often through explicit synchronization mechanisms like mutexes.

Given these differences, the Go version will focus on the core logic: retaining elements in a collection (map or slice) based on a condition. Assuming the collection is a map and the logic is performed within a method of a struct, and considering Go's lack of built-in async functionality akin to Rust's, the Go version will be synchronous. For thread safety, assuming concurrent access, we might use a mutex to protect the map.

Here's a close approximation in Go, assuming a struct similar to the Rust example and a map to maintain clients, each with a timestamp:

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// Assuming a Client struct that has a timestamp field.
type Client struct {
    timestamp time.Time
}

// ClientManager manages clients and ensures thread-safe operations.
type ClientManager struct {
    sync.Mutex   // Embedding a mutex for thread-safe modifications to the map.
    clients map[string]Client // Key could be a unique identifier for each client.
}

// RemoveOldEntries removes clients from the map whose timestamp is older than the specified threshold.
// Does not use Go's goroutine or channels for simplicity and direct translation.
func (cm *ClientManager) RemoveOldEntries(olderThan time.Time) {
    cm.Lock() // Ensure exclusive access to the clients map.
    defer cm.Unlock()

    for key, client := range cm.clients {
        if client.timestamp.Before(olderThan) { // If a client's timestamp is older, delete it from the map.
            delete(cm.clients, key)
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    cm := ClientManager{
        clients: make(map[string]Client), // Initialize clients map.
    }
    
    // Assuming we have some clients added here.
    
    // Remove clients older than a specific date.
    cm.RemoveOldEntries(time.Now().Add(-24 * time.Hour)) // Example: Remove clients older than 24 hours.
}
```

This Go code does not directly mirror Rust's asynchronous behavior as Go handles concurrency differently, usually through goroutines and channels. However, this code provides a thread-safe method to remove entries from a map based on their timestamp, similar in aim to the Rust original but adapted for Go's idioms and practices. Note that the Go `time.Time` comparisons are done with methods like `Before`, equivalent to the `>` operator in Rust for `SystemTime`.
