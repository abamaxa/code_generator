new

```rust
        fn new(address: SocketAddr) -> Arc<Self> {
            let (sender, _) = channel::<RemoteMessage>(100);
            Arc::new(Self {
                _address: address,
                sender,
            })
        }
```


To convert your Rust snippet to Go, we need to translate the Rust concepts to their Go equivalents where possible. Keep in mind that Go and Rust have different idioms and designs, especially when it comes to concurrency and memory safety, which might result in not just a direct translation but an adaptation.

Given the Rust code snippet seems to be part of a bigger struct definition, I'll make a few assumptions for a meaningful translation:
1. `Self` refers to a struct that holds an IP address and a sender part of a channel.
2. `RemoteMessage` is a type for messages to be sent over the channel.
3. We're using an asynchronous channel with a buffer size of 100 in Rust.

Below is how a similar setup could be implemented in Go. Note that Go's standard library provides a package "net" for network-related operations, including handling addresses, and channels are built into the language itself.

Additionally, Go doesn't have constructors in the same way as Rust, but it's common to implement a `New` function that acts like a constructor.

```go
package main

import (
    "net"
    "sync"
)

// Assuming RemoteMessage is a struct we want to send through the channel.
type RemoteMessage struct {
    // Message fields...
}

// The struct that is similar to the 'Self' struct in Rust.
type MyStruct struct {
    address string        // Using string to represent an address for simplicity.
    sender  chan RemoteMessage // The channel for sending RemoteMessages.
}

// New creates a new instance of MyStruct, similar to the Rust 'new' function.
// It takes an address of type string (could also use net.Addr for more complex scenarios)
// and returns a pointer to MyStruct, similar to how Arc<Self> is used in Rust for reference counting.
func New(address string) *MyStruct {
    // Creating a buffered channel of RemoteMessage with a capacity of 100.
    sender := make(chan RemoteMessage, 100)

    // Instantiating MyStruct and returning a pointer to it.
    return &MyStruct{
        address: address,
        sender:  sender,
    }
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    address := "127.0.0.1:8080"
    instance := New(address)
    // Assuming there's logic to use `instance` beyond this point...
}
```

Notes:
- Rust's `Arc` for atomic reference counting does not have a direct equivalent in Go. Instead, Go encourages the use of garbage collection and pointers. When shared ownership is needed across goroutines, Go's concurrency model and use of channels, along with synchronization primitives from the `sync` package (like `sync.Mutex` or `sync.WaitGroup`), are typically used.
- The example uses a string to represent the address for simplicity. Depending on the use case, you could also explore `net.Addr` in Go for a more appropriate representation.
- Unlike in Rust, where sending and receiving from a channel might be asynchronous (and requires awaiting the operation in an async context), channels in Go block the goroutine they are in until the send/receive operation can proceed, making them inherently synchronous within the context of their goroutines.
