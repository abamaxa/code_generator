list_players

```rust
    pub fn list_players(&self) -> Vec<PlayerListItem> {
        self.inner
            .iter()
            .filter_map(|(key, client)| match client.role {
                ClientRole::Player => Some(PlayerListItem {
                    name: key.to_string(),
                    last_message: client.last_message.clone(),
                }),
                _ => None,
            })
            .collect()
    }
```


To convert the Rust function `list_players` into Go, we need to first understand what it does:

- It iterates over a collection (most likely a map based on the context), filtering by a specific condition (in this case, clients with the role of "Player").
- Then, it maps each qualifying item into a `PlayerListItem` struct, which contains a `name` and `last_message`.
- Finally, it collects these items into a vector and returns it.

Given that Go does not have generics (as of my last update in 2023) in the same way Rust does, nor does it have a direct equivalent of Rust's `filter_map` iterator method, we'll need to manually iterate over the collection and build the slice (Go equivalent of Rust's `Vec`) ourselves.

Assuming we have a struct named `Client` which has a field `role` of a custom type (perhaps an enum in Rust, which we'll treat as a constant in Go) and a field `last_message`, and another struct `PlayerListItem` with similar fields to what's seen in Rust, our Go code could look something like this:

```go
package main

import (
    "time"
)

type ClientRole int

const (
    Player ClientRole = iota // assuming other roles are defined similarly
)

type Client struct {
    role        ClientRole
    last_message time.Time
}

// PlayerListItem represents an item in the list of players.
// It includes the player's name and the time of the last message.
type PlayerListItem struct {
    Name        string
    LastMessage time.Time
}

// ListPlayers iterates over the map of clients, filters out those with the role of "Player",
// and returns a slice of PlayerListItem containing their names and last message timestamps.
func (s *Server) ListPlayers() []PlayerListItem {
    var players []PlayerListItem

    for key, client := range s.inner { // Assume s.inner is a map with client data
        if client.role == Player {
            players = append(players, PlayerListItem{
                Name:        key,
                LastMessage: client.last_message,
            })
        }
    }

    return players
}

// Assuming a Server struct that contains the inner map of client information
type Server struct {
    inner map[string]Client
}

func main() {
    // Example usage
    server := Server{
        inner: map[string]Client{
            "player1": {role: Player, last_message: time.Now()},
            // Add more clients here
        },
    }

    players := server.ListPlayers()
    for _, player := range players {
        println(player.Name, player.LastMessage.String())
    }
}
```
This Go code defines a `ListPlayers` method on a `Server` struct that achieves a similar outcome to the original Rust code. We iterate over a map (s.inner), filter clients based on their roles, and return a slice of `PlayerListItem`. Note the use of `append` to dynamically grow our slice of player items. Also, keep in mind that `iota` is used to simulate an enum for `ClientRole`, and the use of a `map` to simulate the collection structure from the original Rust code.

The `LastMessage` field's type was assumed to be `time.Time` for demonstration purposes, adjust according to your actual type.
