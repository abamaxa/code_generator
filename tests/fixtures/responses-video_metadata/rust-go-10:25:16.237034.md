is_subdirectory

```rust
fn is_subdirectory(path: &Path, base: &Path) -> bool {
    // Canonicalize the paths to remove symbolic links and other artifacts
    let canonical_path = path.canonicalize().unwrap_or_else(|_| path.to_owned());
    let canonical_base = base.canonicalize().unwrap_or_else(|_| base.to_owned());

    // Check if the canonical path starts with the canonical base path
    canonical_path.starts_with(&canonical_base)
}```


To convert the provided Rust code to Golang, we need to adapt certain aspects of path manipulation and error handling to fit Go's idiomatic way. Here's how the Rust function can be translated to Go, including comments to guide through the process:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

// isSubdirectory checks if the given path is a subdirectory of the base path.
// It first canonicalizes both paths to resolve any symbolic links.
// Then, it checks if the path starts with the base path.
func isSubdirectory(path, base string) bool {
	// Canonicalize the paths to remove symbolic links and simplify to absolute paths.
	canonicalPath, err := filepath.Abs(path)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error canonicalizing path, using original path instead:", path)
		canonicalPath = path
	}

	canonicalBase, err := filepath.Abs(base)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error canonicalizing base path, using original base instead:", base)
		canonicalBase = base
	}

	// Clean the paths to have a consistent comparison, removing any trailing slashes.
	canonicalPath = filepath.Clean(canonicalPath)
	canonicalBase = filepath.Clean(canonicalBase)

	// Check if the canonical path starts with the canonical base path.
	// To ensure it is a subdirectory, we also check that the next character in the path
	// (if it exists) is a path separator, to avoid false positives with similarly named directories.
	if len(canonicalPath) > len(canonicalBase) && canonicalPath[:len(canonicalBase)] == canonicalBase {
		nextChar := canonicalPath[len(canonicalBase)]
		return os.IsPathSeparator(nextChar)
	}
	return false
}

func main() {
	// Example usage:
	base := "/path/to/directory"
	path := "/path/to/directory/subdirectory"
	if isSubdirectory(path, base) {
		fmt.Println(path, "is a subdirectory of", base)
	} else {
		fmt.Println(path, "is not a subdirectory of", base)
	}
}
```

In this Go version of the function, we make use of `filepath.Abs` to resolve paths to their absolute form, similarly to `canonicalize` in Rust. In case an error occurs during path resolution, the original input path is used, mirroring the Rust version's behavior. Both paths are cleaned using `filepath.Clean` to ensure a consistent comparison. The function checks if the `canonicalPath` starts with `canonicalBase` and also verifies there's a separator after the base path portion to confirm itâ€™s a legitimate subdirectory. The `main` function demonstrates an example usage of `isSubdirectory`. 

Please note that error handling and printing are shown in this context for educational purposes - depending on your application, you might want to handle errors differently.
