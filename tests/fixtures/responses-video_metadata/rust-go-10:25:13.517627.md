MetaDataError

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct MetaDataError {
    pub code: MetaDataErrorCode,
    pub path: PathBuf,
    pub message: Option<String>,
    pub video_details: VideoDetails,
}```


To convert the provided Rust code into Go (Golang), we first need to understand what the Rust code does. The Rust code defines a struct named `MetaDataError` with four fields: `code`, `path`, `message`, and `video_details`. It uses `#[derive(Debug)]` for easy debugging (printing), `pub` to make fields public, and employs several types like `MetaDataErrorCode`, `PathBuf`, `Option<String>`, and `VideoDetails`.

In Go, there's no direct equivalent of Rust's enum or `Option` types as seen with `MetaDataErrorCode` and `Option<String>`, respectively. We'll approximate these as closely as possible using Go's existing types and idioms.

- For `MetaDataErrorCode`, we can assume it's an enum in the Rust version; in Go, we can use a custom type with constants.
- `PathBuf` from Rust is essentially a path handling type, which in many cases in Go, is simply handled with a string type unless more advanced functionality is needed.
- `Option<String>` in Rust is a way to have a string that may or may not be present. In Go, the zero value of a pointer (e.g., `*string`) or just using an empty string can serve a similar purpose.
- `VideoDetails` would be another struct, which we need to define in Go as well.

Below is how one might convert the Rust struct to Go, adding comments to explain each part of the conversion:

```go
package main

import (
	"path/filepath" // Importing filepath package for handling file paths, somewhat similar to PathBuf in Rust.
)

// MetaDataErrorCode is a custom type to represent various metadata error codes.
// Assuming MetaDataErrorCode in Rust is an enum, we achieve similar functionality in Go using constants.
type MetaDataErrorCode int

// Here we should define constants for MetaDataErrorCode as per the Rust code's enum values.
// For example:
// const (
//     ErrorCodeInvalid MetaDataErrorCode = iota
//     ErrorCodeMissing
//     ErrorCodeExpired
// )

// VideoDetails is a struct defining details about a video.
// The definition should mirror the Rust VideoDetails struct's fields and types.
type VideoDetails struct {
    // Assuming structure, fill in with actual implementation.
}

// MetaDataError is a struct that mimics the Rust struct for storing error metadata.
// It includes a code, path to the file, an optional message, and details about the video.
type MetaDataError struct {
	Code          MetaDataErrorCode // Direct mapping from Rust, assuming MetaDataErrorCode is appropriately defined.
	Path          string            // PathBuf in Rust is replaced by a string assuming file path handling is basic.
	Message       *string           // Option<String> in Rust is represented by a pointer to a string in Go; nil when not present.
	VideoDetails  VideoDetails      // Direct mapping from Rust.
}

func main() {
    // Example initialization and usage of MetaDataError
    errMsg := "An error occurred" // Simulating an optional string in Go.
    error := MetaDataError{
        Code:         ErrorCodeInvalid, // Assuming a constant ErrorCodeInvalid has been defined as part of MetaDataErrorCode.
        Path:         filepath.Join("path", "to", "file"), // Example path.
        Message:      &errMsg, // To simulate Rust's Option, using pointer; nil can represent None.
        VideoDetails: VideoDetails{/* Assuming some initialization */},
    }

    // In Go, you would typically handle the potential absence of Message by checking if it's nil before dereferencing.
    if error.Message != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error Message:", *error.Message)
    }
    // To print the struct in a debug-friendly way, you can use fmt package's Printf with %+v verb.
    fmt.Printf("MetaDataError: %+v\n", error)
}
```

This Go code tries to mirror the structure and functionality of the provided Rust code with some necessary adjustments to fit Go's type system and idioms. Remember, without the exact definitions of `MetaDataErrorCode` enums and `VideoDetails` struct from the Rust side, we have to make some assumptions on their implementation in Go.
