get_thumbnail_path

```rust
fn get_thumbnail_path<P: AsRef<Path>>(thumbnail_dir: &PathBuf, video: P) -> PathBuf {
    let input_filename = video
        .as_ref()
        .file_stem()
        .unwrap_or_default()
        .to_string_lossy();
    let output_filename = format!("{}_thumbnail.jpg", input_filename);
    thumbnail_dir.join(output_filename)
}```


Given your request, below is the conversion of the provided Rust function into Go, including comments to describe the translation and logic of the code.

```go
package main

import (
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"
)

// getThumbnailPath takes a directory for thumbnails and a video file path,
// then generates a thumbnail file path within the specified directory.
// It replicates the behaviour of the Rust function in Go.
// - `thumbnailDir` is the directory where the thumbnail will be stored.
// - `video` is the path to the video file.
// Returns the path for the generated thumbnail image.
func getThumbnailPath(thumbnailDir, video string) string {
	// Extract the base name (without extension) of the video file.
	// In Rust, `file_stem()` is used for this purpose.
	baseName := strings.TrimSuffix(filepath.Base(video), filepath.Ext(video))

	// Construct the output filename by appending "_thumbnail.jpg" to the baseName.
	outputFilename := baseName + "_thumbnail.jpg"

	// Join the thumbnail directory with the new filename.
	// This is the equivalent to the `join()` method on `PathBuf` used in Rust.
	thumbnailPath := filepath.Join(thumbnailDir, outputFilename)

	return thumbnailPath
}

// Example usage
func main() {
	thumbnailDir := "/path/to/thumbnails"
	videoPath := "/path/to/video.mp4"
	thumbnailPath := getThumbnailPath(thumbnailDir, videoPath)
	println("Thumbnail will be saved at:", thumbnailPath)
}
```

### Explanation of Key Differences:

- **Type Handling:** In Rust, the function uses generics with trait bounds (`P: AsRef<Path>`) to allow for flexibility with input types. Go's approach is simpler and uses strings to represent file paths.
  
- **Error Handling:** The Rust code expects that `.file_stem()` may fail and has a fallback to a default value. However, in this basic Go translation, there is no explicit error handling on file name extraction. In a more complex application, you might want to add error checks, especially after operations like `filepath.Base` or `filepath.Ext`, though they are unlikely to fail in normal conditions.
  
- **Path Operations:** Rust's `Path` and `PathBuf` types have no direct equivalent in Go. Instead, Go's `path/filepath` package is used for similar operations, like joining paths or extracting file names and extensions.

This code directly converts the Rust logic but, it is important to note, Go handles errors explicitly, so in a complete application, you may want to add error handling around file path operations if there's a risk of invalid paths or other issues.
